Ï€Intellectual property

Creations of the mind that have value but can exist purely as data with no physical form

# Types of software licenses

## Public domain

- not technically a license
- software where the legal protections that are typically granted to intellectual property have either expired, been surrendered or are simply inapplicable.
- not protected by copyright and anyone can legally copy, modify and distribute public domain software
- might not come with source code, but usually does

## Free and Open source

- software where users are given freedom to change, copy, study and share the software
- same rights as [[#Public domain]] but
- still protected under copyright
	- copyright owners may use this protection to require that the software must always be distributed with source code, that attribution to the original authors must always be provided or that any modifications must use a similar licence if they are also distributed
