# Unauthorised access

- occurs when data owned by someone is used by someone else without permission
- could lead to data loss or other not nice consequences

Unauthorised access can occur due to one or more of the following reasons:

1.  Poor authentication
2.  Poor access control or authorisation
3.  Poor understanding of privacy policies

# Authentication

- process of verifying the identitiy of a user
- requires them to prove their identity by providing evidence from one or more of the following categories

1.  Something the user knows, such as a password
2.  Something the user owns, such as a mobile phone
3.  Something unique that is measured from a physical part of the user, such as a thumbprint

Each category of evidence that is used for authentication is called an authentication factor.

Prevents identity theft

## Passwords

- Only known to the user
- Usually entered with a user name that identifies who the user is claiming to be
- Can be a poor form of authentication

### Bad practices

- Avoid birthdates
- Avoid surnames
- Avoid easily guessable passwords

- Avoid re-using passwords
- Avoid leaving them unchanged

### Solutions

1. Use a mixture of lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers and symbols
2. Use unique passwords for each computer or online account
3. Update at least once every 90 days

## Security tokens (2 factor authentication)

- Usually used when more than one authentication factor is needed
 - Generates an OTP for 2 factor authentication
 - (Security token itself) Alternative to mobile phones for the process of 2 factor authentication
 - Users should keep security tokens safe and secure
 - Report any missing tokens as soon as possible

### Process

1. User authenticates with their password or personal identifiication number (PIN)
2. User enters in one-time password (OTP) generated by security token or mobile phone

### Pros

- Intruders have to guess both the user's password and one-time password

### Cons

-  OTPs sent wirelessly can be intercepted and used
- If the secret algorithm used to generate OTPs is poorly chosen or accidentally revealed, intruders may be able to generate OTPs without a security token

## Biometrics

- Measurement of human characteristics
	- Fingerprint
	- DNA
	- Face
	- Iris
	- Retina
- More secure as physical characteristics measured are typically unique to each user and cannot be easily replicated

## Access control or Authorisation

- Once authenticated, the ability of the computer to control the acces of data and resources is given to the user
- This is called access control or authorisation
- Ability of a computer to control a userâ€™s access to data and resources
