> Collection of wires for transporting data from one part of the computer to another

# Types of buses (for our syllabus)

## Data bus

- Transport pre and post-processed data to and fro the CPU
- bi-directional; pre-processed/requested data sent from memory to CPU; processed data sent from CPU to memory

## Address bus

- specifies memory address information
- uni-directional; CPU to memory only
	- when the processor reads from or writes to memory (RAM), the relevant address information is provided on the address bus

# Examples

## Reading data from memory (RAM)

1. CPU requests the data by sending its address via the address bus
2. The memory then sends back the requested data via the data bus

## Writing data to memory

1. CPU uses both data and address bus at the same time
	- Uses the data bus to transport the data for writing
	- Uses the address bus to transport the destination address so that the memory knows where to store it
