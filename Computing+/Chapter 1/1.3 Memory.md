- used to store data

# Types of Memory

## Processor Registers

- physically located inside the processor
- extremely fast but small data storage spaces
	- used directly by the ALU and control unit
	- number and size of processor registers cannot be changed without changing the processor

## Random Access Memory (Main Memory)

- where data and instructions are stored temporarily so that they can be quickly accessed by the processor when needed
	- e.g. when an application is started, its instructions may be loaded into RAM
	- Data stored on RAM can be easily changed and is also volatile, which means that it is lost once the power supply to the computer is interrupted.


1.  Read-only memory (ROM) is where data and instructions that rarely need to change or would be needed for a computer to start up are stored. Data stored on ROM cannot be easily changed and remains there regardless of whether the power supply is switched on or off. This makes it ideal for storing instructions that are needed before data can be loaded into RAM.
    
2.  Secondary storage is where large amounts of data are stored, such as in a hard disk or hard drive. To avoid confusion, we typically use the word “storage” for this kind of storage space instead of the word “memory”. Different storage media are used for secondary storage. The different kinds of storage media will be discussed in section 1.6.
