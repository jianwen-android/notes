# Wired vs Wireless network

| **Factor**                              | **Wired**                                                                                                                 | **Wireless**                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**                                | Initially cheaper but becomes more expensive as network grows in size due to the cost of cables                           | Initially expensive due to the cost of wireless networking equipment but becomes more cost-effective as network grows in size                              |
| **Speed of transmission and bandwidth** | Faster and higher bandwidth as cables provide dedicated connection                                                        | Generally slower and lower bandwidth due to possible interference from radio waves or microwaves; varies according to user location in relation to network |
| **Reliability**                         | More reliable as data transmission is unaffected by interference                                                          | Less reliable due to potential interference from radio waves and microwaves or blockage from physical obstructions                                         |
| **Security**                            | More secure as the network is less susceptible to interception and hacking                                                | Less secure due to possible intrusion by hackers                                                                                                           |
| **Mobility of users**                   | Lower as network connections are fixed at specific spots and users cannot move to other locations                         | Higher as users can move about freely within the range of the wireless network                                                                             |
| **Scalability**                         | More cumbersome to add new devices to the network as physical constraints and the running of cables need to be considered | Easier to add new devices to the network as the router can be easily configured                                                                            |
| **Physical organisation**               | Tends to look more disorganised due to cables running across floors                                                       | More organised without cables                                                                                                                              |
