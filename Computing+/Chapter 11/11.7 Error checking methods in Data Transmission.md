- data can become lost or corrupted during transmission
- data is usually broken and sent in smaller packets, and not in a single stream
	- therefore, we should focus on checking packet by packet

# Parity check

- additional bit is appended or preppended to a string of binary data
- parity bit can be either 1 or 0, depending on system used
	- in a odd parity system, the total number of '1' bits (including the parity bit itself) should be odd
	- in a even parity system, the total number of '1' bits (including the parity bit itself) should be even
	- so, if the total number of '1' bits is already odd in a odd parity system, the parity bit should be 0; vice versa
	- damn simple you got this

## Limitations

- can detect error, cannot detect where the error occured
- if there are 2 or more bits changed, it might not be able to detect the error
	- "parity checking can only detect errors when an odd number of bits have been corrupted but not when an even number of bits have been corrupted." - textbook

# CHECKSUM HAHAHAHAHA

- CALCULATED VALUE THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF TRANSMITTED DATA
- IS A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER FOR THE DATA AND IS SENT TOGETHER WITH IT
- BEFORE TRANSMISSION
	- CHECKSUM IS CALCULATED
	- E.G. ASSUME THE CHECKSUM IS 1 BYTE LONG
	- IF THE SUM OF ALL BYTES IN THE DATA IS < 255, THEN THE CHECKSUM IS THAT SUM
	- IF THE SUM OF ALL BYTES IN THE DATA IS > 255, THEN THE CHECKSUM IS THAT SUM % 256
	- THE CHECKSUM IS THEN SENT WITH THE DATA
- AFTER TRANSMISSION
	- THE CHECKSUM IS RECALCULATED USING THE DATA RECEIVED
	- THE CHECKSUM IS RECEIVED IS COMPARED WITH THE CHECKSUM CALCULATED
