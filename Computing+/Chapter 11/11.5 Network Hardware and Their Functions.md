# Network Interface Controller (NIC)

 - enables the transfer of data between a device and a network
 - can connect to a network physically or wirelessly
- has a unique 48-bit MAC address, see [[8.4 Applications of number systems#Mac Addresses|Chapter 8 MAC Addresses]]

# Network hub (hotspot)

- simplest way to connect multiple devices to the same network
	- acts a loudspeaker
	- it broadcasts the data to all its connected devices
	- does not limit data to only the specific device it was intended for
	- when a hub receives a packet 
		- transmitted to all devices connected to the hub
	- when a device responds
		- response is sent to all devices connected to the hub
- **cheapest option** as it does not store any information about the devices connected to it
- can cause bottlenecks in overall network efficiency as it transmits data to all connected devices regardless of the intended recipient

# Network switch
- constructs a single network by connecting multiple similar networks together
