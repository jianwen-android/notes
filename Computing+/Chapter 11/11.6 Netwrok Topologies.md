# Bus topology

- think electronics bus
	- common cable/backbone is known as the bus; bus is a medium that allows transmission of data
	- every device is connected to the bus (in parallel for electronics haahahahahahahaha)
	- allows all devices to communicate with other devices on the bus (server/printer/other computers etc.)
	- sender will transmit data along the bus and all the devices connected to the bus can detect that data is being transmitted
		- but only the intended recipient will accept and process the data

## Advantages

- easy and cheap to install
	- uses less cabling than other network designs
- scalable
	- new computers can be easily added
- can continue to operate even when one of the computers break down (hahahahahahahah)
- good for small networks

## Disdvantages

- a break along the bus may disable the entire network (hahahaha)
- capacity and length of the bus will limit the size of the network
- 1 bus is unsuitable for networks with many computers; 
	- performance slows down as the number of computers increases

# Ring topology

- its a ring.
- each device is is connected to 2 other adjacent devices
	- all data is passed around in the same direction of the ring
- the entire network will fail,
	- if a failure occurs in the cable or
	- if a computer breaks down

## Advantages
