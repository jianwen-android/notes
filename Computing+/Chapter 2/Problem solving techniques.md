# Algorithm

- Set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

# Decomposition

- Breaking down a complex problem or process into smaller and more manageable and easier to understand parts (known as [[#Sub-problem]])
- parts are evaluated separately and the solutions to these parts are then combined to solve the original problem

## Sub-problem

- A problem whose solution contributes to the solution of a bigger problem

# Pattern recognition

Identifying similarities among two or more items

- identifying patterns amongâ€¦
	- 2 or more problems
	- 2 or more solutions
	- 2 or more steps in a solution

# Generalisation

- Technique of replacing two or more similar problems or solutions with a single, more general problem or solution
- can be done to both problems and solutions
- allows us to solve a large number of problems with a single solution
