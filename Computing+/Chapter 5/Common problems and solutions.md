There are other ~~simply~~ algorithms at the top that I will neglect to write about

# Check digit

- Digit or letter that is **added to a sequence of digits** to **detect errors in manual input**
- mathematically related to the original sequence of digits
- simple input errors, such as accidentally swapping two digits or wrongly entering a digit, would break this mathematical relationship and hence be detected
