# Techniques

## Scale

- Choose a scale with a factor of 2 or 5
- Can choose to draw horizontally
- Indent

## Line

- Draw a best fit line with equal number of points, above and below the line

## Axis

## Plotted points

When taking points from the line, measure to half the smallest division of the scale

# Planning

## IDP and DP

- State explicit your independant variables (x - axis) and dependant variables (y - axis)
- State 2 **measurable** values that should stay constant throughout the practical

## Procedures

### Setup

- State the setup through words or with a diagram

### Testing

- State a value for the independant variable for the procedure to test with first
- State how the dependant variable will be measured
- Reiterate "steps a to b, c amount of times" to obtain more values for the experiment

### Conclusion

- How do you obtain the unknown value? (usually using gradient)
	- Mathematical manipulation of the gradient will usually require you to perform some operation on the independant or dependant variable
- Create a graph with c amount of rows
	- Column headers should be e.g.
| Time/s | Length/cm | Time^2/s^2 |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
|        |           |            |

# Errors

## Parallax error

## Human error

- **MUST BE SPECIFIC IN WHAT IS THE HUMAN ERROR**
- e.g. Human reaction time errror
	- Due to human reaction time, the results obtained from the experiment will have some inaccuracies

# Things to note

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instruement
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
