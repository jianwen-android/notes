# Techniques

## Scale

- Choose a scale with a factor of 2 or 5
- Can choose to draw horizontally
- Indent

## Line

- Draw a best fit line with equal number of points, above and below the line

## Axis

## Plotted points

When taking points from the line, measure to half the smallest division of the scale

# Planning

## IDP and DP

- State explicit your independant variables (x - axis) and dependant variables (y - axis)
- State 2 **measurable** values that should stay constant throughout the practical
	- These values must also be significant to the experiment

## Procedures

### Setup

- State the setup through words or with a diagram

### Testing

- State **1** value for the independant variable for the procedure to test with first
- State how **1** dependant variable will be measured ( show that by varying the independant variable, you will obtain different dependant variable values)
- "Repeat steps a to b for further values of y" to obtain more values for the experiment

### Conclusion

- How do you obtain the unknown value? (usually using gradient)
	- Mathematical manipulation of the gradient will usually require you to perform some operation on the independant or dependant variable
- Create a graph with c amount of rows
	- Column headers should be e.g.
| Time/s | Length/cm | Time^2/s^2 |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1      | 2         | 1^2           |
- "If the suggested relationship is correct, a ___ graph will be obtained as shown"
	- Craft a suitable graph using the appropriate **x** and **y** (from your manipulation) axis variables, and the suggested relationship between them
	- Usually a linear graph
- "The value of ___ can be determined from the ___ of the graph"
	- Usually from the gradient cause there's not much else you can get from a linear relationship

## Relationship between variables

- Typically linear

### Gradient (Linear)

- Typically a constant that needs to be found
	- Questions can be asking you to find the gradient
	- Or find a constant that can be found through the gradient

## Risk and

# Errors

## Parallax error

## Human error

- **MUST BE SPECIFIC IN WHAT IS THE HUMAN ERROR**
- e.g. Human reaction time errror
	- Due to human reaction time, the results obtained from the experiment will have some inaccuracies
- if there is a stopwatch involved you could talk about reaction time in starting or stopping the stopwatch
	- repeat the experiment several times and take the average time to reduce errors

-   for conversion of energy, can talk about loss of thermal/potential energy to surroundings; precaution would be to provide insulation or lubricate the surfaces respectively

## Systematic errors

### Oscillations or moving parts

- affected by wind

-   can also be that the apparatus used is not precise enough? then for the precaution ya just use a more precise one (eg ruler vs vernier calliper)

# Things to note

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instruement
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
