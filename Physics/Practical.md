# Techniques

## Scale

- Choose a scale with a factor of 2 or 5
- Can choose to draw horizontally
- Indent

## Line

- Draw a best fit line with equal number of points, above and below the line

## Axis

## Plotted points

When taking points from the line, measure to half the smallest division of the scale

# Planning

## IDP and DP

- State explicit your independant values (x - axis) and dependant values (y - axis)
- State 2 **measurable** values that should stay constant throughout the practical

# Things to note

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instruement
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
