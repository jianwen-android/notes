# Errors

## Parallax error

## Human reaction time error

- reaction time in starting or stopping the stopwatch
	- repeat the experiment several times and take the average time to reduce errors

## General/Systematic errors

- apparatus used is not precise enough
	- e.g. using meter rule to measure diameter of a pendulum bob
	- use a more precise one (e.g. vernier calliper)

## Optics and light

### Lens

- The middle of lens holder may not coincide with the center of the lens.
	- This affects the accurate measurement of l.
	- The sharpness of image may not be consistent throughout the experiment as it is estimated by eye. This affects the accurate measurement of l.

### Pins

- The holes made by the optical pins are large
- The pin nearer to the eye may appear larger and obstruct the pins and images behind through a wider angle
	- This affects the drawing of the reflected ray accurately and affects the accuracy of the angle of reflection
	- Use pins of smaller diameter as it will make smaller holes

## Oscillations or moving parts

- affected by wind
- unable to identify the maximum and the minimum points of the pendulum when oscillating

## Electronics

- Error resistance wire
    There may be kinks on the resistance wire which cause the length of resistance to be longer than 100.0cm. This will increase the voltmeter reading which is inaccurate

# Miscellanous

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instruement
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
- DP Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
