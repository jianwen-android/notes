# Errors

## Parallax error

## Human error

- **MUST BE SPECIFIC IN WHAT IS THE HUMAN ERROR**
- e.g. Human reaction time errror
	- Due to human reaction time, the results obtained from the experiment will have some inaccuracies
- if there is a stopwatch involved you could talk about reaction time in starting or stopping the stopwatch
	- repeat the experiment several times and take the average time to reduce errors

-   for conversion of energy, can talk about loss of thermal/potential energy to surroundings; precaution would be to provide insulation or lubricate the surfaces respectively

## General/Systematic errors

- apparatus used is not precise enough
	- e.g. using meter rule to measure length of a pendulum bob
	- use a more precise one (e.g. vernier calliper)

## Optics and light

### Parallax error

### Pins

- if pins are used to mark the position and the path of light when refracting or reflecting
- we can state that the pins might be too thick, creating a bigger margin of error and therefore an inaccuracies in our results

## Oscillations or moving parts

- affected by wind

## Electronics

### Heating effects

- AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS **conducting electricity**, heating effect will cause an increase in resistance
	- doesn't matter whether they are ohmic or non-ohmic conductors
	- heating in a conductor is caused by the current flowing through a conductor
	- Power = current^2 * resistance = voltage^2 / resistance

# Miscellanous

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instruement
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
- DP Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
