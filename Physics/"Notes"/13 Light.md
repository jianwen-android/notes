# Notes

a) & b)

- normal: imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary or wtv
- angle of incidence: angle between the normal and the ray when it approaches a medium
- angle of reflection: angle between the normal and the ray when it moves away from a medium
- angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- point of incidence: point where incident, reflected ray and normal meet
- smooth surfaces: reflection is regular
- irregular surfaces: reflection is diffused

# Things to note

1. Drawing ray diagrams
	1. Draw all your arrowheads for light rays (dotted lines for "image" light rays)
	2. Label your image and object
	3. Correct location/drawing
2. Critical angle
	- angle of incidence in the optically denser medium at which the angle of refraction in the optically less dense medium is 90 degrees.
	- for total internal reflection to occur, the light ray must be travelling in an optically denser medium, striking its boundary with an optically less dense medium at an angle of incidence bigger than the critical angle of the optically denser medium
