# Notes

a) & b)

- normal: imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary or wtv
- angle of incidence: angle between the normal and the ray when it approaches a medium
- angle of reflection: angle between the normal and the ray when it moves away from a medium
- angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- point of incidence: point where incident, reflected ray and normal meet
- smooth surfaces: reflection is regular
- irregular surfaces: reflection is diffused

# Things to note

1. Drawing ray diagrams
	1. Draw all your arrowheads for light rays
	2. Label your image and object
	3. Correct location/drawing
