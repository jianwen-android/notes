# I-V Graph

# Functions

- blocks current from flowing backwards

# Usage

## Flyback Diode

- prevent "kickback" current when turning off a big load, from flowing through the load
- ensures that the load will not be damaged by reverse current

## AC Rectifier

- connected in 4s for full bridge, 2s for half bridge
- converts AC to DC by ensuring that there is no negative voltage
- **positive curve is not recitified** (see [[6.2 Amount of charge a capacitor can store]] and [[Zener Diode]])
