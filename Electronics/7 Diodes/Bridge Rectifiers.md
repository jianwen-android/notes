WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF A RECTIFYING CIRCUIT YO

# 1.  Transformers

1.  Help to step up or down your AC voltage level

# 2.  Rectifying

1.  Full bridge
2.  Half bridge
3.  That other obscure one that no one uses anymore ()
    

# 3.  Filtering
![[6.5 Resistor-Capacitor (RC) Circuit#Rectifier Filtering]]
# 4.  Regulator

 1. If voltage across the capacitor is high enough, the zener diode will hold it at Vz
 2. Remember your resistor for the diode yo
