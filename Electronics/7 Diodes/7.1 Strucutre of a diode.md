# Semiconductors

- used to make diodes
- doped with different impurities
	- either n-type or p-type
- conveniently:
| Anode (Positive) | PN-Junction | Cathode (Negative) |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| P-type           | Also known as the depletion region            | N-type                   |
- additionally, the lead closer to the band on the diode is the cathode:
