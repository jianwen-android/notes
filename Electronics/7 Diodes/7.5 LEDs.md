# Current limiting resistor

- V_f = forward voltage of LED
- I_F(AV) = current rating of LED
- E = voltage of source
$$ R = \frac{E-V_F}{I_{F(AV)}} $$
- ensures that current is not exceeded, since V_F is always constant
- prevents damaging the LED

# LED vs Incandescent

## LED

- energy efficient (money saving in the long term)

## Incandescent

- no polarity
