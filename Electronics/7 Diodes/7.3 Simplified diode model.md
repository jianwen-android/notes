# I-V Graph

- practical model but less curvy

1. reverse region
	- diode acts as an open swtich and I_D = 0A
2. forward region (< V_k)
	- diode is treated as if it is reverse-biased
3. forward region (> V_k)
	- diode acts as an closed switch and I_D > 0A

# Braindead (Analogy)

- diode can be seen as a switch in series with a reversed battery
	- when switch is connected in "forward bias", it is closed and the battery has a 0.7V E.M.F
		- therefore, using KVL, voltage drops by 0.7V
- vice versa for reverse biased, except the battery part
- who thinks like that man, just set aside some new space for a new idea called diode already
