Hi there, and welcome to my note-taking system template! I built this system as an attempt to create a well-organized, expandable home for notes within Notion; one that takes advantage of Notion's unique features while also bringing in some of the capabilities that I love in apps like Evernote and Apple Notes.

To learn how to use this system, check out this video:

Alternatively, you can read the article version on my website:

[How to Build the Ultimate Note-Taking System in Notion - Thomas Frank](https://thomasjfrank.com/notion-note-taking-system/)

I've chosen to put the instructions there instead of directly in this note so that you can safely delete this note and still be able to go back to the instructions on my site.
