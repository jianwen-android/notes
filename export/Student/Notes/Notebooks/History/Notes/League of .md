### Disagreement about the role of the League

Wilson (USA) : The League should be like a world parliament in which representatives of all nations would meet regularly to reach agreements

George (UK) : The League should only meet when an emergency arose

Clemenceau (France) : The League should be a strong organisation with its own army

# Aims

### Collective security

- "An attack against one is an attack against all"
- To achieve world peace through international cooperation
- Commitment to open, just & honourable relations between members
    - No secret alliances etc.

### Disarmament

- Aim: to reduce the ability of countries to wage war
- To be achieved through international agreements
- E.g. TOV required Germany and her allies to disarm; Allied Powers also required to disarm

## Other aims

- Promote open, fair & honourable relations between nations (prevent alliance systems/ secret treaties)
- Lay out system of international law
- Maintain, modify treaties between nations

# Peacekeeping measures (In order)

1. Moral persuasion
    1. All members of the League would publicly condemn the country
    2. Persuade the offending country to stop
2. Arbitration
3. Economic sanctions
    1. Prevents the exchange of foods, goods or supplies between the members of the League and the offending nation
4. Military sanctions
    1. Prevent selling of weapons
    2. Send in military
- Disarmament
    - Separate step

### Example

1. A commission of enquiry determines if a nation was guilty of aggression
2. Hold talks with the guilty party (Arbitration & use of moral persuasion)
3. League *encourages* members to impose economic sanctions collectively (thus cutting off trade & financial relations)
4. Take military action to protect victim

# Problems

## Structural

- Uncoordinated efforts made by various parts of the League â†’ ineffectiveness
- Secretariat â†’ understaffed and disorganised
- Conference of Ambassadors â†’ often made decisions unilaterally (by themselves)
- Ill-defined working relationship between the GA and the Council
- Authorisation for any action required:
    - A unanimous vote by the Council â†’ permanent members had veto powers
    - 2/3 majority vote in the Assembly
- Limited membership
    - USA did not join because of its non-interventionist policy - isolation â†’ LON lacked the US' economic and military support to enforce its will
        - Some Americans did not like the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in which the League's Covenant was included
        - Some Americans did not want to be involved again in European's disputes or wars
        - American businessman were worried about the costs of maintaining the League and its decisions
        - Adopted isolationism
    - Germany denied from joining until 1926
    - USSR denied from joining until 1934

## Mentality of great powers

## Lack of authority & credibility (Pg 22)

- Due to its close association with the TOV (it was established by the Treaty)
- Came to be seen as a league for victorious nations â†’ more than half of its members fought with the Allies in WWI

[[Inadequate peacekeeping measures]]

## Post-war attitudes of the major powers (Pg 24)

- Shaped by their post-war experiences and circumstances
    - **France and Britain** â†’ war-weary; pacifist state of mind. France also wanted to keep Germany weak
    - **Italy** â†’ dissatisfied with its share of spoils after WWI
    - **Japan** â†’ felt it deserved a larger share of the Far East + insufficient resources
    - **USA** â†’ isolationism
- **Appeasement** (Pg 24-25)
    - Policy and attitude adopted by Britain and France towards the aggression of Nazi Germany in the 1930s
- **Climate of distrust** (Pg 24-25)
    - Members were unwilling to disarm; wanted to protect their interests and territories
    - Affected the relations between the powers

<aside>
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ Ultimately, the **major powers prioritised their own self-interests** over that of the League's goal of international peace and security

</aside>

# Successes of the League

- Social issues
    
    **Significant progress was made after World War I in several areas**
    
    - The League helped *millions* of refugees to return home after the war.
    - The Health Commission of the League helped to reduce the *spread of contagious diseases* through international vaccination programmes and helped to reduce fatalities from such diseases
    - The League also worked to reduce the smuggling of cheap labour, opium and dangerous chemicals across international borders

# Failures of the league

- **Mukden Incident, 1931** (Pg 25)
    - Seizure fo the Manchurian city of Mukden (now Shenyang, Liaoning province, China_ by Japanese troops; renamed it ***Manchukuo***
    - ***Lytton Commission*** appointed by the League; labelled Japan the aggressor
    - **Japan withdrew from the LON; occupied Mancukuo in 1932**
    - Many countries had important trading links with Japan
    - The League of Nations could not agree on sanctions or even a ban on weapons sales. Britain and France did not want a war, so nothing was done.
- **Abyssinian Crisis, 1935-1936** (Pg 26)
    - Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935
    - Sanctions imposed by the League were not very harsh; ineffective
    - Secret negotiations: Hoare-Laval Plan
    - May 1936: **Italy conquered Abyssinia**
    - 1937: **Italy left the League**
