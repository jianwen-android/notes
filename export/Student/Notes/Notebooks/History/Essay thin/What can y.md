I can learn that collectivization was not effective.

Prior to 1913 and World War 1 (WWI), Russia was using traditional farming methods as compared to the rest of Europe which had undergone or were undergoing Industrialization, improving the efficiency of production in areas such as Agriculture. This was due to the Tsarist rule, which dictated a technological isolation to prevent a similar industrial revolution in the rest of Europe. Despite that, it was still producing 86 million tons of grain. Additionally Stalin's predecessor, Lenin, had implemented his NEP in Soviet Russia.

However, I can learn that collectivisation was not effective, as prior to WWI, Russia was already producing more grain than when collectivisation was introduced (86 > 73 and 86 > 69). It was only after 12 years where they able to beat their record. Had Russia just followed through with the NEP, they would have continued producing yield that was sustainable. Collectivisation wasted precious time that Russia needed to catch up with other European powers.
