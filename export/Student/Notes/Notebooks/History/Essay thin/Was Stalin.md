I believe to a great extent that Stalin's ruthless personality was the main reason why he came to power. For example, Stalin's ruthless backstabbing and execution of his fellow party members and competitiors played major roles in his rise to power. However, the party also chose not to publish Lenin's testament, which although was not due to his ruthlessness, still benefitted his rise to power.

1. PEEL (The party choosing not to publish Lenin's testament)
    1. One reason that Stalin came to power was not due to his ruthless personality, but due to the Politburo's decision not to publish Lenin's testament.
    2. Lenin's testament, a 2 part document written by Lenin, gave criticism of his successors - Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, Bukharin, and most importantly, Stalin. It detailed on the arrogance of Trotsky
    3. However, after Lenin passed, the party members came to a consensus that they will not publish the testament to the public and follow his advice.
    4. Therefore, Stalin retained his position as Secretary-General, which he later used to great effect during his rise to power.
    5. Thus, one reason for Stalin's rise to power was not due to his ruthlessness
2. PEEL (Backstabbing of fellow political party members)
    1. Stalin's ruthless personality did help him to backstab his competitors.
    2. He exploited the single-mindedness of his competitors and their ideological divisions - he initially allied with Zinoviev and Kamenev to attack the Left Opposition and remove Trostsky. He then switched sides and attack Bukarin and Rykov, who led the Right Opposition, essentially turning them against each other
    3. His ruthlessness in getting rid of his rivals meant that he was willing to change his views on NEP. 
    4. By exploiting the divisions within the party,he was able to boost and reinforce his own politcal position, rising to power
3. PEEL (Ruthless execution of said party members through show trials and assassinations)
    1. As Stalin grew in power, he made sure that there would never be any resistance to his totalitarian government. He did so through the Great Purge - 
    2. After the exiling many of the former Politburo members, Stalin went a step further and there was no possibility of them ever fighting back against his rule
    3. After working with them for many years, Stalin 
    4. For example, Stalin ordered a show trial for many of the former members of the Politburo, such as Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov and Grigory Zinoviev. Specifically, Grigory ZInoviev was accused of taking part in terrorism against Stalin. The old party members would be executed after being found guilty in said trials.
4. Conclusion
