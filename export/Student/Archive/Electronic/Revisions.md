# Formulas

## Fundamentals

### Wire resistivity

$R = ρl⁄A$

- ρ is the Ohm meter of the material of the wire
- l is the length of the wire
- A is the cross sectional area of the wire

### Ohm's law

$V = IR$

- I is the current/rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit. (A)
- R is the resistance (Ω)

### Ampere

$I = Q/t$

- Q is the coulomb/charge of electricity from electrons at a point when 1 amp current flows through for 1 second
- t is the amount of time (seconds)

### Power

$P = VI$

- V is potential difference/electromotive force (Voltage)
- I is current (Ampere)

### Work done

$E = Pt$

- P is power (Watts)
- t is the amount of time (seconds)

### Efficiency

> Efficiency = Useful Output energy/Input Energy X 100%
> 

Pretty intuitive

### Effective resistance

For series circuit:

$R_t = R_1 + R_2 + R_3...$

For parallel circuit:

$R_t = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 ...$

<aside>
💡 If the circuit only has 2 resistors in parallel, you can use the alternative formula provided

</aside>

$R_t = (R_1 * R_2)/(R_1 + R_2)$

.... I cant even be bothered for the rest if you dont even know this youre actually just screwed

## Power rating for resistors

1. Calculate power output of the resistor
2. *2
3. Find 1 that is higher than your calculated answer
