Here is an example of text that you could type into your note-taking system. Other text might be even better here, but right now, this is what you've got. Make it count - or delete it and add your own. I don't care; I'm not your dad.

Bullet list example:

- A cool item
- A less-cool item (If you ain't first, you're last)
- A quietly dignified item

Pro-tip: I make heavy use of [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) with Notion. You can set Greenshot to copy your screenshots to your clipboard, then instantly paste them into Notion. No cumbersome uploading needed.
