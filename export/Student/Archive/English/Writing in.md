There are 4 basic types of sentences:

1. **Declarative sentence**: A statement, e.g., I like English lessons.
2. **Imperative sentence**: A command, e.g., Finish your rice.
3. **Interrogative sentence**: A question, e.g., Why aren’t you walking faster?
4. **Exclamatory sentence**: A sentence that expresses great emotion, e.g., slow down!

All sentences have a subject and a predicate, that is, someone or something (subject) and what it is they are doing (predicate). There is a star and there’s action.
