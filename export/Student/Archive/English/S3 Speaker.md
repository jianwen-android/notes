# S3 Speaker Series

During the talk, you are to write down notes in your EL journal, making sure to take down key ideas and that you have acquired the answers to the 2 questions you had before talk. (Refer to your SLS assignment) There will be a post-dialogue discussion and reflection when you come back to school.
