# Student B

Context: 1. Already has a personal computer at home
2. Receiving new laptop for school uses only
Perspective: DMA helps to keep me focused in school and it does not affect me as I can turn to my personal computer at home if I want to use a computer for non-school related activities
Quote + Opinion / Inspiration for perspective: "We know students have their own devices to use if they really want to stay up late."
Not applicable to me
