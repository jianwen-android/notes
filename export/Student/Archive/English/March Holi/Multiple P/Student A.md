# Student A

Context: 1. Low income family
2. Receiving first ever laptop
Perspective: DMA is restrictive
- Keeps me focused on learning in school
- I am unable to use it for personal purposes where a computer is required
Due to family being unable to afford a personal computer for me, I have to use my laptop with the DMA's restriction even outside of school
Quote + Opinion / Inspiration for perspective: For instance, students can propose educational YouTube videos or channels to be made accessible.
This allows me more freedom to access educational content in school
