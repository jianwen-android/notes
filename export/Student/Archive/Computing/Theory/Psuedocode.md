Description of an algorithm using natural language (such as English) mixed with *sequence*, *selection* and *iteration* constructs

- Less diagrammatic than a flowchart -- it‚Äôs all in words!
- More code-like than an algorithm -- doesn‚Äôt have to be in full sentences.
- Still **sequential**.
- Can be gradually transcribed into your programming language of choice.

# Purpose

- Working on projects in a team
- Working with others who may not be

familiar with programming language

- Help you make sense of a complex problem
- Part of the planning process to help you write a program without worrying about syntax (yet)
- Gives you a big picture of your solution

## Rules

- There are no ‚Äúrules‚Äù (technically)
    - No fixed syntax
- Key purpose is **clarity**
- Eventual goal is (likely) to transcribe the pseudocode into programming language

üí° However!
The syllabus has set in place certain conventions to help you bring out the clarity.
Keywords (written in CAPITAL LETTERS)
