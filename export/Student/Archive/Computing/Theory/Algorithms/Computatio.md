|Computational Thinking|Computer Language|
|---|---|
|Pattern in part of the solution|Use recursion (loops)|
|Pattern in the problem/solution|Write a function|
|Generalisation|Turn the similarities into variables|
|Incremental decomposition|Useful for testing your program|
|Modular decomposition|Consider writing two functions so you can use them separately for other questions with similar patterns|
