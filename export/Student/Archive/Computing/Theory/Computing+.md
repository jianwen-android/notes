Speaker: Steffan Fung, Founder/CEO of ELXR

- It surprised me that for some projects, he was able to break even fast, and still ended up making a loss when running the project afterwards (ELXR)
- I was confused when he started talking about Mr Samuel Lee, until I realised that they were classmates
- I will learn to be more creative with my project, especially with possibly monetizing it and making a startup
