# Electronics Coursework

1. Project plan

2 liner summary (overview)

Project specification

- look at the kinds of input
- output
- what do you want it to do
- paragraph form
- current and voltage levels you are trying to use

Do research on the 3 categories (input, process output)

- input, look at the types of input circuits

- list out the research you have done on the various inputs

- process

- “”

- output

- “”

2. Analysis of Project Specifications

Systematic analysis of project with details of all subsystems

Relevant questions posed that would facilitate a comprehensive research

- Block diagrams with explanations for all subsystems (just a brainstormed version, idea only)
- Research questions lead to useful informations

3. Research

Extensive research for a range of useful information was obtained for further investigation and generation of ideas

Evaluation of most of the findings

- basic features

4. Investigation and Generation of Ideas

Wide

Wide range of ideas were investigated through computer simulations and other appropriate methods

Investigation generates reliable results

- Needs to cover all subsystems supporting project’s primary function
- Documented through screenshots

5. Development of the Proposed solution

Descriptions of how initial ideas were developed into the proposed solution through logical interpretation of the results of investigation

Justifications on the selection of the proposed solution using results of investigation

- Comparisons were made to determine best idea for each subsystem
- Description of how subsystems were linked together to form the overall system was included

6. Description of proposed solution

Provide a complete list of the components used with full technical specifications (can add link here for a pdf)

A complete set of organised, well-structured circuit diagrams with all test points and component values labelled

Clear details of the overall system

- Tech specs found in syllabus indicated
- Test points and component values included in circuit diagrams
- Block diagrams with relevant signals were included (confirm final circuit)

7. Project evaluation

Review project planning implementation based on the learning points (important)

Detailed assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the project

Describe further improvements that are specific and realistic to the project

- learning points and challenges related to project management and technical details were included
- 

8.

11.

Compare between measured results and computer simulation

- Do a one liner to explain the differences
