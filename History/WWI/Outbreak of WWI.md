# Background

- Throughout the 1800s,the European great powers were competing against each other to increase their wealth and power
- Germany was aggressively expanding after its unification in 1871
    - Germany didnâ€™t exist until then
    - Needed to play catch up as they were a newer European country
- Japan and USA were increasingly powerful at the turn of the 1900s
- There were several outbreaks of wars, civil wars & revolutions throughout the 1800s

# Causes of WWI (TB 3-4)

## Competition for Colonies

- Need colonies for
	- Raw material
	- Cheap/Free labour
	- Land for their empire

## Arms and Naval Race

- Great powers needed better weaponry and ships to protect their faraway colonies
- Anglo-German arms race 1907-1914; both countries announcing the creation of new and improved battleships

## Alliance system

- Throughout the 1800s, powers made multiple secret & publicly known alliances with each other so that they would have assistance in the event of a war.
- The secret alliances cause tensions but also a stalemate as there was a balance of power
- The main alliances in 1914 were:
	- Triple Entente: Britain, Russia & France
	- Triple Alliance: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy

## Plans for war

- Many countries believed that a major war was about to break out and made very detailed plans to prepare, e.g.
	- Germany: If a war broke out, likely to fight Russia & France but they would be trapped in the middle. "Schlieffen Plan" -quickly attack & defeat France, then focus on Russia who would be likely slower to mobilise
	- Russia: Badly equipped army but able to deploy millions. Planned to overwhelm Germany & Austria-Hungary by sheer numbers
	- France: Plan 17 - French troops charge across the frontier and attack deep into Germany, forcing surrender
	- Britain: Set up British Expeditionary Force (BEF), collaborate with France; activate 150k professional soldiers on short notice
- The existance of these plans and the believe that speed was of essence meant a trigger would lead to immediate war.

##  Nationalism

- Balkan states were part of the Ottoman empire
- As the Empire declined, Balkan states attempted to break free and declare independence
- Austria-Hungary and Russia wanted to assert their influences over the region because of access to the Mediterranean
- Austria-Hungary colonized Bosnia; Russia supported Serbia
