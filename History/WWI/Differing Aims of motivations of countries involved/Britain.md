# Britain

## Aims

- Weaken German navy
- Germany to pay a high price (by the public & Parliament)
- Stable Germany

## Reasons

- Prevent its naval superiority from being threatened
- Britain suffered large number of casualties during the war
- Germany would be a buffer against Communist Russia & a potential trade partner
    - It would only be a small amount of time before Russia starts spreading its communist ideas around the world
    - Germany needs to be stable so that it does not fall to a communist revolution like Russia
