# USA's role

## Economic strength

### Industrial capabilities

- The USA was the largest industrial producer in the world at the time
- Initially focused on production of consumer goods, but transitioned quickly to military equipment
- Depression left many jobless
	- These people were more willing to work and therefore more effective
	- Compared to forced workers in fascist states

### Sinking of Japanese merchant ships

- The Japanese were not able to protect their ships from being attacked by American Submarines
- The American attacks weakened Japan's economy even further as the war continued

### Contribution of women

- USA: Filled the roles that men previously had. (wartime jobs, Military enlistment, Keep the country running, operate farms)
- Japan and Germany: Only encouraged women to join the work force late into war, by then industries and supply routes alr crippled.
- Working in factories to produce weapons, vehicles & military supplies necessary for the war effort.

## Superior military strength & strategy

### Dolittle Raid

- Intended to fly off of an aircraft carrier and not return
- Bombing raid on Tokyo; considered a spectacuar surprise attack (against the Japanese)
- Was the first good news for the Allies
- Only 14 tons of bombs on key targets
- Crash landed in Allied China

## Battle of Coral Sea

- For the first time, Japanese were halted
- Was more of a stalemate
- First naval air engagement
	- Inexperience on both side

## Battle of Midway

- Island in the middle of nowhere
- Japan tried to bomb and conquer
	- Can be used to attack Hawaii
- Intercepted communications from Japan led to the USA being able to win this battle

## Over-extension of empire

### Island hopping (USA)

#### Advantages

- Gain control of only the required islands in the Pacific to launch an attack mainland Japan
- Less time and manpower to face all islands

#### Disadvantage

- Lost a lot of lives
	- Japanese were more experienced in fighting in those climates
- Drawn out over 3 years

## Harsh treatments of the

Initially welcomed by some Asians (Colonial subjects). However as time went on, Japanese brutality led to underground movements which opposed Japanese rule.

## Kamikaze stretegies

- Crashing planes into enemy warships with the intention to inflict maximum damage
- Many of the Kamikaze pilots were shot down, landed in the wrong spot, or missed the ships entirely
- Japan was losing more pilots than it could train their replacements

### Consequences

- Heavy casualties motivated the Allies to seek a quick resolution to the war

# Other reasons

## Allied victory over Europe

### Britain’s entry

• The Far East was low on British strategic priorities
throughout 1942-1943; suffered repeated defeats
against Japan due to lack of resources’
• Resorted to disruption tactics to break Japanese lines
• Nov 1943 – Admiral Lord Mountbatten took control of
SEAC; more men, aircraft, equipment & supplies
available
• British fought off Japanese attempt to invade India;
Japan lost 60k men
• British regained Burma by May 1945
• Planned to recapture Malaya & Singapore but
Japanese surrendered in Aug due to atomic bombs

### USSR
- 
## Atomic Bomb
- Was it really necessary to force Japan to surrender using atomic bombs?

- they didnt have enough planes to shoot down bombers
	- kamikaze left japan with almost no pilots left
	- aa cannot hit high flying bombers
- they didnt foresee that the plane was carrying atomic bombs
	- after being bombed so many times, they thought it was just another raid

### Japanese refusal to surrender

- Because of their code of honor (e.g. fighting to the last person)
- Japan was negotiating surrender but the Americans wanted **unconditional** surrender
- Americans decided to use the bomb to prevent high casualties
	- force unconditional surrender because japan was being too childish

### Soviet Union
- American president was anti-communist
- USA also wanted to end the war in Japan without Soviet help
- USSR was promoting communism to other parts of Europe
- dropping atomic bomb will demonstrate USA's military capabilities and give them a leverage in future meetings and negotiations
