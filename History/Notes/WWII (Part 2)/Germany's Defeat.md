# 02 germany’s defeat

## Battle of britain, 1940

### Raf strengths

- Led by Sir Hugh Dowding - planned British air defence since 1947. Brought in technical developments, eg. bullet proof windscreens for fighter planes; command & communiation systems
- Invested in radars, able to detect enemy planes before they arrived
- Fighter planes such as Spitfire & Hurricanes were faster than German planes
- RAF pilots who bailed out over Britain could return to duty

### Luftwaffe weaknesses

-   Hermann Goering was not good at tactics - shifted focus of attacks, causing confusion; Did not implement radars
-   Wrong type of aircraft- Stuka dive bomber were geared towards supporting army by bombing, not dog fights
-   German fighters only had enough fuel to fly for 30 min over England and had to return to France
-   German pilots who bailed out over Brtain became prisoners
