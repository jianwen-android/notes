 # Germany role (self-inflicted)

## Battle of britain, 1940

## Raf strengths

- Led by Sir Hugh Dowding - planned British air defence since 1947. Brought in technical developments, eg. bullet proof windscreens for fighter planes; command & communiation systems
- Invested in radars, able to detect enemy planes before they arrived
- Fighter planes such as Spitfire & Hurricanes were faster than German planes
- RAF pilots who bailed out over Britain could return to duty

## Luftwaffe weaknesses

-   Hermann Goering was not good at tactics - shifted focus of attacks, causing confusion; Did not implement radars
-   Wrong type of aircraft- Stuka dive bomber were geared towards supporting army by bombing, not dog fights
-   German fighters only had enough fuel to fly for 30 min over England and had to return to France
-   German pilots who bailed out over Brtain became prisoners

# Operation Barbarossa

- Hitler turned his attention to the USSR after his failed attempt to conquer Britain
- He had always been interested in gaining lands in the east
- He decided to launch his attack on the USSR in the spring of 1941 (Operation Barbarossa)
- However, before he could carry out his planned invasion of the USSR, he had to go to the aid of his ally, Mussolini, who was having difficulties in the South

## Hitler mistakes

- Refusing to retreat
- Not sending winter supplies to soldiers fighting in the winter

In the early years, mistakes were not as critical. With Hitler increasingly interfering with battles, more mistakes were made

# USSR & Britain's resistance

What did the USSR do during the winter of 1941-1942 to enable a more effective resistance against the German invasion?

## Soviet Reorganisation

Prior to winter of 1941-1942, Red Army suffered 4 mil casualties, lost 7k aircrafts, 20k tanks; Ukraine occupied, Leningrad & Moscow under siege

German advance halted by winter; Red Army reformed – copied Germany tactics

- Officers in Red Army given greater freedom & independence. Stalin banned Communist Party officials from interfering
- Developed new weapons, e.g. T34 tank
- Adopted radio communications
- Specialist units to listen & disrupt German radio signals
- Harsh discipline (Order 227) ‘not a step back’

## Soviet Resistance

- Soviet people rallied to Stalin & defence of the country
- Stalin called on people to defend ‘Mother Russia’ in fighting the 'Great Patriotic War’
- Nazi brutality helped – savage & inhuman war crimes committed against Soviet people increased the will to resist
- ‘Scorched earth policy’ – Red Army destroyed everything when retreating so that Germans could not gain resources
- Resistance fighters blew up rail links/ sabotaged factories in German-held territory

## Soviet War Economy

- USSR used female labour extensively. 50% of workforce were women. Enabled USSR to produce vast quantities of small weapons. USSR surpassed German war production by 1942.
- By 1943, produced 1.5 times more aircraft & 2 times more tanks than Germany
- Adults in USSR received no food unless they worked for the war effort. Soviet citizens survived on 20% the food ration that British citizens had
- Soviets dismantled 2500 major industrial complexes & transported by rail to Siberia & Kazakhstan; Forced 25 million workers to migrate as well

## Battle of Stalingrad

Sept 1942– Jan 1943

- Stalingrad was major industrial & strategic centre
- If lost, USSR’s links with Southern Russia would be cut off
- Fierce fights, including hand to hand battle
- Soviet pincer movements led to encirclement of German forces
- German commander Paulus wanted to retreat & regroup - Hitler ordered him to fight on.
- Soviet military cut off German supplies & pounded their positions with shells & rockets
- Paulus surrendered, along with 300k soldiers
