# USA's role

## Economic strength

### Industrial capabilities

- The USA was the largest industrial producer in the world at the time
- Initially focused on production of consumer goods, but transitioned quickly to military equipment
- Depression left many jobless
	- These people were more willing to work and therefore more effective
	- Compared to forced workers in fascist states

### Sinking of Japanese merchant ships

- The Japanese were not able to protect their ships from being attacked by American Submarines
- The American attacks weakened Japan's economy even further as the war continued

### Contribution of women

- USA: Filled the roles that men previously had. (wartime jobs, Military enlistment, Keep the country running, operate farms)
- Japan and Germany: Only encouraged women to join the work force late into war, by then industries and supply routes alr crippled.
- Working in factories to produce weapons, vehicles & military supplies necessary for the war effort.
