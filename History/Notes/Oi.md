# Causes for wwi

## Plans for war (4)

-   Many countries believed a major war was about to break out and made very detailed plans to prepare

Examples

Germany: If a war broke out, likely to fight Russia & France but they would be trapped in the middle. “Schlieffen Plan” - quickly attack & defeat France, then focus on Russia who would likely be slower to mobilise

Russia: Badly equipped army but able to deploy millions. Planned to overwhelm Germany & A-H by sheer numbers

France: Plan 17 - French troops charge across the frontier and attack deep into Germany, forcing a surrender

Britain: Set up British Expeditionary Force (BEF), collaborate with France; activate 150k professional soldiers on short notice

-   The existence of these plans and the belief that speed was of the essence meant a trigger would lead to immediate war.

## The trigger - assassination of the archduke of a-h

-   28 June 1914

-   Archduke Franz Ferdinand & his wife Sophia were visiting Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital

-   Shot by Gavrilo Princip

-   He was a member of a Serbian nationalist group that pushed for the Bosnian capital

-   Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany gave a “blank check” to A-H, i.e unconditional support for whatever action A-H chose to take.

-   Emboldened A-H to issue a ten-point ultimatum that would effectively make Serbia a part of A-H empire

-   Serbia rejected the ultimatum

-   A-H declared war on 28 July

## Was germany really defeated?

-   German military leaders agreed to an armistice to stop fighting on Nov 11 1918

-   German army not entirely defeated

-   Germany not yet occupied by enemy forces

-   Many Germans glad war was over

-   Did not feel that Germany had lost the war

-   Leaders hoped they would get a good peace treaty from Allies & there would be room for negotiation

-   Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points seemed to a fair basis for negotiations

# The treaty of versailles & its impact

## What did the germans hope for from the peace conference

-   No compensation, fresh start


-   Newly set up Weimar government was not the one responsible for the war

-   The German economy was also devastated by the war


-   Support for new democratic government


-   Should not bear harsh punishment for what the former authoritarian Kaiser did.

-   Work together for peace, founded on a firm basis of democracy


-   Principle of self-determination to apply to Germany


-   Based on the Fourteen Points promoted by Woodrow Wilson, US President

-   The country would remain a united nation

## Paris peace conference, 1919-1920 (keep germany weak, get compensation for allies, allow self-determination)

-   Discussed terms for establishing peace on a permanent basis

-   Leaders of 32 countries attended

-   Dominated by the Big 3 (France, Britain, USA)

-   Lasted about 12 months

-   None of the defeated countries were invited

-   Russia was omitted. The Allied Powers refused to recognise the Bolshevik government

-   5 treaties were drawn up. Main treaty was the T.O.V. to deal with Germany

-   Big 3 had several disagreements which strained relationships, esp b/w USA and France.

-   Other problems that had to be dealt with through the treaty


-   Public pressure for revenge against Germany due to the loss of lives, economic woes; If the outcome of the conference did not satisfy the public, they could lose the next election in their respective countries.

-   Britain & France made several secret promises to reward countries that helped them fight against Germany in WW1

## What britain wanted + reasons

-   Weaken German Navy


-   Prevent its naval superiority from being threatened


-   Germany to pay a high price


-   Britain suffered a large number of casualties during the war


-   Stable Germany


-   Germany would be a buffer against Communist Russia & a potential trade partner

# League of nations

## Successes in the 1920s

-   Successful Interventions


-   1920; Yugoslavia tried to take over Albania (LON made Yugoslavia withdraw)

-   1921; Both Finland and Sweden wanted the Aaland Islands (Both countries accepted LON’s decision to give them to Finland)

-   1925: Border dispute between Greece and Bulgaria. Greece invaded Bulgaria. (LON made Greece withdraw)

-   The League helped millions of refugees to return home after the war




-   Social Issues


-   The League helped millions of refugees to return home after the war

-   The Health Commission of the League helped to reduce the spread of diseases through international vaccination programmes and helped to reduce fatalities from such diseases

-   The League worked to reduce smuggling of cheap labour, opium and dangerous chemicals across international borders

## Failure in the 1920s

-   Failed Interventions


-   1923; Poland seized Vilna, the former capital of Lithuania (LON could not make Poland withdraw)

-   1923; Ruhr Crisis - France occupied the Ruhr as Germany was not paying reparations (LON could not make France withdraw)

-   1923; Italy took over the Greek island of Corfu (LON could not make Italy withdraw until Greece gave in on the dispute)

## Okay-ish things  in the 1920s

-   Questionable Interventions


-   1921; Both Germany and Poland wanted Upper Silesia (LON let people of Silesia, majority wanted to join Germany, LON split it into 2)

-   1923; Lithuania invaded Memel (LON could not make Lithuania withdraw but gave Memel some independence)

## Failure in the 1930s

-   Mukden Incident, 1931


-   Seizure of the Manchurian city of Mukden by Japanese troops; renamed it Manchukuo

-   Lytton Commission appointed by the League; labelled Japan the aggressor

-   Japan withdrew from the LON; occupied Manchukuo until 1945




-   Abyssinian Crisis, 1935


-   Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935

-   Sanctions imposed by the League were not very harsh; ineffective

-   Secret negotiations: Hoare-Laval Plan

-   May 1936: Italy conquered Abyssinia

# The rise of stalin   

## A. circumstances after the revolution

-   Older ruling elites were replaced

-   By the Civil War’s end, the party’s General Committee and its Politburo left as the key political arenas

-   Ban On Factions


-   Arguments over NEP + Introduction of money & profit-making threatened to split the party as left-wingers criticized the policy. Lenin introduced a resolution on Party Unity

-   Means no one was allowed to criticize Party policies/decisions. Stalin benefitted from the ban. He used it to resist any challenges to the authority he had

## B. non-disclosure of lenin’s testament

-   Lenin’s Testament


-   2 part document dictated by Lenin

-   Dec 1922  and Jan 4 1923

-   Addressed to a future Communist Party Congress


-   Party agreed not to make the document public as Lenin has criticised all of them

-   Trotsky viewed as a greater threat → Ignored Lenin’s warning about Stalin

-   Hence, the Testament did not achieve the effect that Lenin hoped for. Stalin retained position as Secretary-General, which he later used to great effect during his rise to power

## C. weaknesses of stalin’s competitors

-   Leon Trotsky


-   Politically naive & failed to gather support 


(These worked in Stalin’s favour and ultimately assisted Stalin in removing Trotsky as the strongest contender in the power struggle)

-   Chose to remain silent on Lenin’s criticism of Stalin

-   Believed Stalin about Lenin’s funeral date (?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!) 


-   Undermined his position in the party


-   Support base → largely confined to Red Army


-   Put him at a disadvantage compared to Stalin


-   Outspoken, arrogant and unpopular in the Politburo 


(Prompted his political opponents to ally together to discredit and remove him)

-   Openly criticized Lenin and the Party's policies (i.e. NEP) → Seen as acts of disloyalty to Lenin and the Party’s decisions

-   Unpopularity was a result of:


-   His seeming arrogance

-   His power and support in the Red Army

-   Belief in “permanent revolution” (The world!)


-   Cleverly countered by Stalin’s “socialism in one country”, in turn diminishing Trotsky’s credibility in the Party 

## D. ideological divisions within the party

-   Radicals


-   Wanted to pursue communist ideals closely, e.g. War Communism, collectivisation


-   Moderates


-   Followed Lenin’s leadership and ideology closely, e.g. NEP


-   Weakened the Party’s unity. More significantly, the divisions gave Stalin the opportunity to exploit the situation and form alliances with the different factions as and when it was advantageous to him

-   IN this way, Stalin was able to weaken his opponents and ultimately remove them, all of which strengthened his position and facilitated his rise to power

## E. stalin’s strengths

-   A. Capitalised control over Party organisation


-   1922: Lenin made Stalin Secretary-General of the communist party.

-   Stalin was in charge of recording & conveying Party policy

-   As Sec-Gen, his job included recommending appointments, promotions and dismissals

-   Effects:


-   Enlarging and strengthening of Stalin’s support base in the Party

-   Enabled Stalin to outmanoeuvre his rivals


-   B. Skillful politician


-   i. Pretended to have been close to Lenin 


(By pretending to be close to Lenin, Stalin was able to conjure up in the minds of the Russian people that he was Lenin’s natural successor. This would aid him in his rise to power, for such close association with Lenin potentially helped to create the sense of legitimacy needed to be the next ruler of Russia)

-   Organised Lenin’s funeral


-   Developed a cult around Lenin to show his devotion to Lenin

-   Ordered Lenin’s body to be embalmed and displayed

-   Gave funeral speech

-   Stalin as chief mourner

-   Trotsky was absent…


-   ii. Exploitation of ideological divisions/Single-mindedness


*(He was clear in his singular aim - to do whatever was necessary to get rid of his rivals. He was willing to change his views on NEP to achieve his aims, whereas his rivals were not as flexible)

-   Step 1: Ally with Zinoviev & Kamenev (troika)

-   Step 2: Remove Trotsky (who led the Left Opposition)

Resign as the People’s Commissar of Army & Fleet Matters

    & Chairman of Revolutionary Military Council

-   Step 3: Isolate Zinoviev & Kamenev w/ Moderates [1925 - 1927]

-   Step 4: Attack Bukharin & Rykov (who led Right Opposition) w/ Radicals [1928 - 1929]

-   Result: S t a l i n i z a t i o n


-   Therefore, by exploiting the ideological divisions within the Party, Stalin was able to play his opponents against one another while simultaneously boosting and reinforcing his own political position.

# The rise of hitler

## The weimar republic

-   #### Germany was in ruins


-   9 Nov 1918: Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated

-   6 Feb 1919: National assembly met in Weimar


-   1st President: Friedrich Ebert

-   1st Chancellor: Philipp Scheidemann


-   The Weimar Constitution:


-   Adopted on 11 Aug 1911

-   Spelt out the “basic rights and obligations” of government officials and the citizens they served (discriminated against gypsies and homos)


-   E.g. equality before the law, freedom of religion, privacy


-   Agreements: Germany be democratic, proportional representation (everyone gets a chance)


-   Result: no party has a clear majority, several coalition parties

-   Proportional representation:


-   Germans voted for party rather than candidate to fill Reichstag (German legislature)

-   The elections determined the percentage of seats each party received in the Reichstag, but the parties themselves selected the individuals who filled each allotted slot


-   Eg. if a party receives 36% of vote, they get 36% of seats in Reichstag


-   Positives:


-   Prevent concentration of power in hands of one ruler (eg. Kaiser)

-   Wide range of views representing the people’s political orientation


-   Negatives:


-   Too many views, difficult to get consensus

-   Parties could not obtain 50.1% of votes and needed to form a coalition government


-   Parties combing their votes to form the government


-   Structure:


-   People vote for…


-   President ← Has power to dismiss Reichstag, triggering new elections


-   appoints…


-   Courts

-   Chancellor (Prime minister) ← In charge of day-to-day operations of government


-   appoints…


-   Government Ministers


-   Armed forces


-   Reichstag (Parliament) ← German legislature

## The troubled years (19xx - 19xx)

-   (a) Weak Support (Labelled “The November Criminals”)


-   Germans remembered the Weimar Republic for its role in signing the Treaty of Versailles

-   Did not forgive members of the government

-   Desired leaders who would help Germany break the Treaty

-   WR help responsible for the following economic problems


-   Reparations for war damage had effectively bankrupted German economy

-   Loss of Saar, Germany’s industrial heartland and Alsace-Lorraine in the Treaty of Versailles.

-   Fewer goods produced - people lost jobs

-   Soldiers returned home with no jobs


-   Convenient to use the government as scapegoat




-   (b) Economic woes


-   Bad state of economy made things worse

-   Raw materials were under foreign control, Saar and Alsace-Lorraine CENTRES OF IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION

-   Production in mines and factories reduced

-   Led to massive unemployment

-   Shopkeepers and traders suffered as people had less to spend

-   Soldiers were jobless and ended up begging

-   Thus did not have enough money to pay for reparations

-   1923, France was angry and decided to invade Ruhr, an area in western Germany - centre of the country’s heavy industries COALMINES, IRON, AND STEEL WORKS

-   German workers went in strike, silently encouraged by the WR

-   Factories stopped producing goods

-   Prices went up

-   Price increase went out of control; value of money fell

-   Government response: Print more money

-   Money became worthless - HYPERINFLATION


-   Price of egg, 1.6 marks in 1921 went up to 320 000 000 000 marks by Nov 1923

-   Price of bread, 163.15 marks in 1922 went up to 201 000 000 000 marks in 1923


-   People’s savings wiped out

-   Standard of living dropped drastically

-   Many Germans suffered and turned very bitter

-   Many blamed the government

-   Led to support for extreme parties from the right and the left wing




-   (c) Disillusionment with democracy


-   Germany was only formed in 1871 & had a monarchy with Kaiser in charge

-   Lacked a tradition of democracy; desired strong autocratic leaders who could deliver results

-   Belief further reinforced when the government failed to solve its various problems

-   The President used Article 48 of the Constitution to rule by “emergency”

-   Chancellor (PM) often by-passed the Reichstag, using the President’s emergency powers

-   Frequent attempts to overthrow the Weimar Republic by the left & right wing political parties


-   Spartacist Uprising 1919


-   Tried to overthrow the Weimar Government

-   Ebert used army and right wing Freikorps (ex military troops, wanted to restore Kaiser) to shoot the communists and end the rebellion. Lasted 8 days


-   Kapp Putsch


-   Right wing group angry with Weimar Republic for signing TOV. Tried to overthrow the government by violent means

-   Soldiers took over Berlin & declared a new government under Wolfgang Kapp. Lasted 4 days


-   Munich Putsch / “Beer Hall” Putsch, 1923


-   Took place in a large beer hall in Munich

-   3000 Germans gathered there to listen to a speech by the state commissioner of bavaria

-   Hitler jumped on a chair and proclaimed, “The national revolution had broken out”

-   The Nazis then held a demonstration march to the centre of Munich

-   Clashed with the police

-   Hitler escaped but was later arrested

-   Sentenced to 5 years jail to treason

-   Served 9 months in jail before he was released




-   Government Parties


-   EXTREME LEFT

-   Communist Party (KPD)


-   Oppose Weimar Republic

-   Supported by workers and some middle classes


-   Social Democrats (SDP)


-   Supported Weimar Republic

-   Supported by workers and middle class


-   Centre Party (ZP)


-   Supported Weimar republic

-   Conservatives. Originally the party of the catholic party


-   Democratic Party (DDP)

-   Peoples Party 

-   National Party (DNVP)


-   Unhappily accepted Republic

-   Landowners, the wealthy and big business


-   Nazi Party (NSDAP)


-   Opposed Weimar Republic 

-   Founded in 1920, eventual main party of Germany in the 1930s


-   EXTREME RIGHT

## Signs of hope

-   1924-1929 was the golden period of the Weimar Republic

-   Economic and political recovery due to the leadership of Gustav Stresemann

-   Years of Recovery: WR under Gustav Stresemann


-   First as Chancellor (Prime Minister), then as Foreign Minister for much of 1923-29

-   Wanted Germany to be prosperous again

-   Sought better relations with other countries

-   One of his first achievements - persuade the French to withdraw their troops from the Ruhr

-   Helped to get factories producing again

-   People could find more work

-   France agreed provided Germany paid reparations

-   Stresemann agreed but tried to buy time for payment

-   Made a deal with US - Germany would not fall back behind its payments if given more time and loans to help economy recover

-   At the same time, he resolved the currency problem

-   Withdrew all the old money (mark) and replaced it with a new currency (rentenmark) which had proper financial backing

-   Boost people’s confidence in the new currency.

-   Stresemann’s greatest interest was in foreign affairs

-   Aimed to make Germany the strongest country in Europe again

-   Plan was to get on better terms with other countries and convince them to trust Germany again.

-   His hope was to recover some of the lands and rights that Germany had lost at the Treaty of Versailles.

-   Treaty of Locarno


-   Signed with Germany’s wartime enemies in 1925

-   WR agreed not to try and recover any of its lost lands in western Germany

-   Helped make Britain, France and Italy less suspicious

-   Getting Germany into the League of Nations


-   League of Nations - again controlled by Germany’s wartime enemies

-   By joining them in Sep 1926,indicated that they were on better terms

-   Bitter feelings aroused by war subsided


-   Kellogg-Briand Pact ≈1928 [not included]


-   About 40 countries promised to never use wars to solve their problems

-   They would instead turn to the League of Nations


-   Getting the USA to agree to an even better deal about reparation payments


-   The Dawes Plan 1924 in which USA would invest 40 million pounds in Germany

-   Followed by the Young Plan*, made in 1929

-   In return for promising that it would continue to pay reparations, the amount that Germany had to pay was greatly reduced

-   From 6.6 million pounds to 1.85 million pounds

-   Spread over 59 annual payments

-   *Stresemann died of a stroke (was overstresed) :(

## Nsdap (nazi party)

-   1919: Founded as the German Worker’s Party (DAP)

-   Feb 1920: “25 Point Programme”

-   April 1920: renaming of party

-   Nov 1923: Munich Beer Hall Putsch (failed)

-   ………………………..there was something we were too slow D:

-   Aims of the Party


-   End the agreements of the Treaty of Versailles

-   Redraw Germany’s borders to include all German people

-   Only Germans could be citizens of Germany (racial purity)

-   No Jewish people could be members of this new Germany (racism)

-   Rebuilding the German military – essential for Aryan growth

-   Additional living space (colonies) to feed and settle surplus population - Lebensraum

-   The state takes over major industries

-   It was while serving time in prison that he wrote: Mein Kampf (My Struggle)

-   After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Hitler realised that he could come into power only by peaceful means

-   For the rest of the 1920s, concentrated on the organisation of the party

## Hitler’s characteristics / abilities

-   1. Highly adaptable


-   Recognised/acknowledged reasons for the failure of the Munich Beer Hall putsch

-   Reorganised the Nazi Party


-   1924 - won 32 out of 647 seats

-   Hitler formed several organisations to assist in spreading the Nazi propaganda

-   1927 - won 12 seats… but by 1929, he was in a strong position to take advantage of any crisis that might occur

-   Increase Party membership


-   Hitler Youth


-   Reorganising the SA and establishing the SS


-   Sturmabteilung (SA)


-   Storm Troopers / Brownshirts

-   Set up in 1921 as Nazi Party’s paramilitary organisation

-   Employed violent methods


-   Other parties

-   Communists (rich hates them so give money to Nazi)


-   Reorganised in 1925

-   From Jan 1931: headed by Ernst Rohm

-   By 1933, army was 1 million strong


-   Schutzstaffel (SS)


-   “Protective Echelon”

-   Black-uniformed elite corps

-   Founded in April 1925 as Hitler’s personal bodyguard

-   Headed by Heinrich Himmler from 1929


-   Used Nazi propaganda


-   Joseph Goebbels


-   Altered political strategy


-   Legality strategy

-   Work within parliamentary system




-   2. Skilful in making deals with politicians


-   Willing to wait for the right opportunity to take power gradually


1. Jan 1933: Nazis 44% of electoral votes → convinced Nationalist Party to combine ⇒ coalition government

2. Convincing Von Papen + Hindenburg to offer him chancellorship 

-   1st year as Chancellor → ruled in a coalition government

-   Subsequently → acted decisively to take complete control of the government (when he held enough support)




-   3. Charisma and Oratorical skills


-   Powerful speaker and communicator

-   Key characteristics / things he did:


-   Highly emotive; strong body language → prepared and practised his speeches

-   Addressed people’s concerns by exploiting their fears


-   Offered simple solutions to big problems

-   Knew the people’s concerns.

-   Used “November criminals”, communists and the Jews as scapegoats for Germany’s ills

## Favourable circumstance (overview)

-   (i) Death of Stresemann


-   After the death of Stresemann, there were no other capable leaders to handle Germany’s political and economic problems

-   Germany’s lost faith in democracy as the leaders were unable to solve their problems

-   Preference for authoritarian leadership rose again




-   (ii) The Great Depression of 1929


-   American economy collapsed with Wall Street Crash of 24 October 1929

-   USA withdrew loans to Germany, leading to collapse of economy again; & 6 million unemployed by 1933

-   Communists & Nazis promised solutions to these problems;

-   Data shows that extremist parties gained support at the expense of moderate parties.


-   Nazis; 

-   1928: 12 (before depression)

-   1930: 107 

-   Jul 1932: 230

-   Nov 1932: 196 (beat up too many people)




-   (iii) Fear of Communism


-   Rich industrialists, farmers, and bankers supported the Nazis as they feared that the Communists might win the elections & suffer similarly to those in USSR.

-   They thought that the Nazis would offer a strong solution to Germany’s woes and thus good for the economy

-   They knew Hitler was anti-communist and would avert a revolution similar to that of USSR




-   (iv) Failure of Opposition Parties to Unite


-   The Nazis never ever won a majority (51%) in the Reichstag

-   However the Communist Party, Centre Party & Social Democrats refused to unite due to political differences

-   Leading politicians convinced a reluctant president Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor, convinced they could manipulate Hitler and use his popularity to rule Germany

-   Hindenburg had no choice but to appoint Hitler as Chancellor in 1933

## Chancellor to hitler

-   1. Destroying democracy


-   New Elections


-   Called for new elections for the Reichstag, March 1933

-   Although the Nazi party was the single largest party in the Reichstag, Hitler wanted an overall majority


-   Influencing the Campaign


-   Stopped newspapers from criticizing the Nazis

-   Dismissed officials who opposed Hitler

-   Use uniformed followers to break up meetings of other parties and beat up opponents (SA & SS)

-   Extreme Nazi violence throughout the election campaign, especially against the communists


-   The Reichstag Fire


-   A week before the elections, the Reichstag building in Berlin went up in flames

-   Hitler blamed the fire on the communists

-   Used this as an excuse to issue an emergency law

-   This law removed freedoms promised by the Weimar Republic


-   Right to a fair trial

-   Free press


-   The fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis but the Germans did not know this then

-   Used emergency powers (Article 48; Reichstag Fire Decree) to arrest Communists, break up meetings & frighten workers


-   Results of March 1933 Elections


-   Nazis obtained 44%

-   With the help of the Nationalist party, managed to scrape through with an overall majority of 51%


-   The Enabling Act, 1933


-   Hitler now schemed to have the Reichstag give up its powers and rule as a dictator.

-   To do this, the Reichstag had to pass an “Enabling Act” which required ⅔ majority

-   4 WAYS to get the Enabling Act approved


-   1. Used SA & SS to intimidate the Reichstag

-   2. Banned communist deputies from coming to the Reichstag so they could not vote

-   3. Persuaded the Centre Party to vote for the Act by giving vague promises, e.g. not interfere in Catholic Church/schools

-   4. Using the votes of his allies, the Nationalist Party.


-   Because of the Enabling Act, democracy died in Germany. How?


-   1. Hitler could pass any laws for the next 4 years.

-   2. Other political parties were banned by July 1933

-   3. Trade Unions taken over by the Nazis

-   4. Press, radio and cinema placed under total Nazi control

-   5. Opponents arrested, imprisoned or killed

-   6. Concentration camps and forced labour camps

-   7. SS and Gestapo struck terror into many Nazi opponents

-   8. Many fled the country e.g. Albert Einstein and the writer Thomas Mann




-   2. Getting rid of all opposition


-   The Night of The Long Knives 1934


-   German army officers were unimpressed with Hitler & SA

-   Ernst Rohm, leader of the SA, was disappointed


-   Not given a more important role in the new government

-   Wanted to turn SA into a 2nd German Army

-   Had control of 4 million men.


-   Started to create trouble for Hitler


-   Hitler wanted to have complete power within his own party

-   Decided to get rid of him and many of his followers

-   Hitler called the leaders of the SA to a special conference

-   During the night, he had them dragged out of bed by SS and shot

-   Accused Rohm of plotting against him

-   On the same night, many other political opponents all over Germany suffered the same fate

-   Gained acceptance with the military.

-   No public protests - demonstrated Hitler’s power and the people’s fear

-   30th June: This became known as the Night of The Long Knives




-   3. Combining roles of Authority


-   2 months later, President Hindenberg died (democracy died with him. Why?)


-   The only one with the popularity to sack Hitler


-   Hitler combined the jobs of Chancellor and President

-   He also became commander in chief of the armed forces

-   He was now the supreme dictator of Germany: Fuhrer

## Controlling lives

-   Nazi Party - implemented many ways of controlling the lives and influencing the thoughts of the German People

-   From 1933-1945, Germany was a totalitarian state


-   No rival parties, no political discussions, complete obedience to der fuhrer

-   Controlled every aspect of people’s lives


-   How did they achieve such control?




-   1. Political Control (One Party Rule)


-   All other political parties banned

-   Anyone who criticized the Nazis were sent to concentration camps

-   Civil Service, Police, Law Courts taken over by Nazis

-   Trade Unions banned

-   People were watched everywhere - at work, at school, even at home!

-   A blockwart (PARTY REPRESENTATIVE) in every street

-   There was also the Gestapo and the SS

-   Anyone could be arrested and sent to concentration camps w/o evidence or trials

-   Caused people to live in great fear

-   Use of fear alone will not suffice




-   Propaganda, culture & mass media were crucial tools to ensure Nazi success in controlling people

-   Minister of Enlightenment & Propaganda - Joseph Goebbels controlled the following: Magazines, books, music, film, art, radio broadcasts

-   Controlling access to information meant people could only listen to Nazi ideas & aims, thus accepting them readily 

-   Key ideas that Goebbels propagated:


-   Sense of belonging

-   Power and strength

-   Order

-   Superiority of the Aryans 

-   Success

-   Vision for the future

-   German expansion

-   Inferiority of Jews




-   2. Social Control


-   (i) Education of the Young


-   Hitler was especially keen to win over the minds of young people

-   Education was carefully controlled


-   There was Race Studies as well as German, History and Geography

-   Teachers were monitored


-   Children were encouraged to be loyal to their Fuhrer (leader), to pu him and their fatherland above everything else

-   Lessons taught included:


-   Germany army betrayed in WWI

-   Jews responsible for problems

-   Germans belonged to Aryan race

-   Other races were sub-human


-   Hitler Youth Movements: Girls and boys encouraged to join this organisation

-   Divided into different sections according to age

-   Those who did not join found it difficult to get in the University or to find jobs after leaving school

-   Compulsory by 1939

-   Little Fellows (6 - 10)

-   German Young People (10 - 14)

-   Hitler Youth (14-18)

-   Young Maidens (up to 14)

-   German Maidens’ League (14 - 18/21)

-   .

-   .

-   .

-   .

-   .






-   3. Racial persecution of Minorities


-   Anyone not belonging to the “Aryan” race was persecuted

-   Inferior races and all threats to Nazi ideas about family life/master race had to be eliminated

-   Prostitutes (sex disease), criminals (transfer criminal genes), gays (no Aryan kids), beggars, alcoholics, gypsies, mental/physical handicaps, people with hereditary illness

-   Non-lethal methods:


-   Enforced sterilisation; concentration/labour camps


-   Lethal methods:


-   Death through gas/starvation/injection


-   The Jews


-   Nazis had always attacked the jews

-   Jews were blamed for all of Germany’s problems

-   Once in power, the Nazis began a campaign of anti-semitic persecution

-   Jews were arrested and beaten up

-   Many were forced out of their jobs

-   Jewish shops had slogans painted over their windows

-   People were discouraged from buying their goods

-   Many left Germany but most stayed

-   They had nowhere else to go

-   .Between 1933 and 1938, laws discriminating against Jews were passed:


-   Jews were not allowed in the civil service and the judiciary

-   Jews were not considered German citizens

-   Jews could not take part in economic activity

-   Jews had to carry identity cards and passports which identified them as Jews


-   1935 - Nuremberg laws (Forbade Jews to marry non-Jews)

-   Persecution turned violent in 1938 (Kristallnacht - The Night of Broken Glass)

-   Mass murder of Jews - what the Nazis called “The Final Solution” to the “Jewish problem” did not take place until after the outbreak of WWII




-   4. Religious Control


-   Germany was a Christian country

-   Protestants and Roman Catholics (RCs)

-   Hitler did not trust the churches

-   Feared that they had too much influence over the people

-   Did not like the idea that people were more loyal to the churches than to him

-   Early on, Nazi allowed church autonomy

-   In return, churches accepted alignment of Nazi goals

-   Hitler tried to bring the churches under his control

-   Created a new Reich Church with a Nazi bishop in charge (Ludwig Mueller)

-   Promoted alternative religion - glorified Nazis & Hitler (Symbol is curved swastika)

-   Curbed all Christian activities & education

-   However, many Germans seemed quite happy with the Nazi regime

-   Little protest over Nazi racial and social policy

-   Some German Christians saw through Hitler and condemned Nazism as the enemy of their faith

-   Many were arrested because they refused to give up their beliefs

-   E.g. Pastor Martin Niemeller, Dietrich Bonhoeffer

# Causes for wwii

HITLER’S ACTIONS

How it contributed to the outbreak of WW2

Withdrawal from the LoN & the Geneva Disarmament Conference

This allowed Hitler to pursue his aggressive foreign policy without having to regard the objections and threats from the League, as well as enabled Germany to proceed with rearmament

Resumed Conscription and Rearmament in Germany

Doing so enabled Hitler to rebuild the German military and in turn incrementally further his ambitions of Lebensraum and the repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles

Remilitarised the Rhineland

The successful remilitarisation of the Rhineland encouraged a further loss of confidence in the League. At the same time, it emboldened Hitler to take additional actions towards achieving his expansionist goals

Involvement in the Spanish Civil War

This gave Hitler an opportunity to test the newly rebuilt German military capability which was important in Hitler’s plans to establish a Greater Germany and create lebensraum. To aggravate matters, the lack of action on the part of the League of Nations strengthened Hitler’s view that Britain and France were weak, which in turn made him aggressive with his demands.

Anschluss with Austria

This allowed Hitler to freely exploit Austria’s resources of gold and iron ore, as well as its army and weapons, all of which were significant to Hitler’s expansionist plans. Furthermore, with the international inaction, it once again encouraged Hitler to believe that he could easily break the Treaty of Versailles and do as he pleased without needing to account for them. Consequently, he would be spurred to take more aggressive action to fulfil his aims.

Gained Control of the Sudetenland

With Hitler gaining the Sudetenland without having to fight, it encouraged Hitler to be more ambitious in his plans, leading him to set his sights further on occupying the whole of Czechoslovakia.

Gained Control of Czechoslovakia

It pushed the world closer to war not only by emboldening Hitler to take further action but also convincing Chamberlain that Hitler could not be trusted. The latter in particular and subsequent warning to Hitler were notable as it signified the possible end of appeasement and the actual military clash between Nazi Germany and the Allies.

Invasion of Poland 🔥

This was the immediate spark to the outbreak of WWII, for it finally convinced Britain and France that Hitler could not be trusted, and his quest for expansion could not be stopped with appeasement. This therefore pushed them towards declaring war on Nazi Germany.

## Weaknesses of the league of nations 2.0

-   ##### Failure of Disarmament


-   The League were unable to achieve much success in disarmament

-   Success achieved in disarmament was achieved through the efforts of individual major European powers and not the League.


-   Washington Naval Conference (1921) [success]


-   Set a ratio for tonnage of capital ships among major powers

-   USA : BR : JP : ITA : FRA

-      5    :   5  :  3  : 1,67 : 1,67

-   Re-negotiated later with ratio of USA:BR:JP →  7:7:5

-   Both times the USA did not think of Japan as a major power which made them angry


-   Locarno Treaties (1925) [questionable success]


-   Terms of the Treaty of Versailles accepted by the Weimar government


-   League Commission to prepare for World Disarmament Conference (1926) [failure]]


-   Britain and France refused to cooperate


-   Kellog-Briand Pact (1928) [failure]


-   Agreement that conflicts should be resolved in a peaceable manner. However, no clear way to enforce pact


-   World Disarmament Conference (1932-1934) [failure] Organised by the League


-   Germany insisted other powers should match its disarmament level

-   France refused to limit its own armaments

-   Britain and USA refused to commit to the level requested by France

-   Germany withdrew from the Conference and the League


-   Major powers… 


-   Refused to cooperate when the League organised major disarmament conferences in 1926 and the 1930s.

-   Did not trust each other and placed their own national interests above international peace.


-   The failure of disarmament highlighted the importance of USA in international affairs 


→ Its economic and military strength commanded more influence and respect than the weakened European nations in the league

-   The League leaders, Britain and France were weakened by WW1 and the great depression

### → preferred to focus on national interests rather than the interests of the league

-   Unwillingness to disarm and compromise meant that no meaningful progress could be made by the League towards disarmament.

-   This led to a general atmosphere of distrust and tension that would ultimately lead to… WW2 

-   This meant that powerful countries had the military capacities for war, and the League could not stop them from engaging in conflicts




-   ##### Abyssinian Crisis


-   Benito Mussolini’s aims


-   Make Italy a great power

-   Exact revenge for Italy’s defeat to Abyssinia in 1896

-   Exploit Abyssinia’s mineral wealth


-   Dec 1934: Dispute between Abyssinia & Italy (in Somalia). Abyssinian Emperor Haile Selassie appealed to the League for help

-   3 Oct 1935: Using the dispute as a pretext, Italy invaded Abyssinia. This breached the League of Nations covenant

-   Measures taken by the LON


-   Imposed an embargo on certain products to Italy but delayed ban on sale of oil as it did not want to hurt the economic interests of League members (did not include oil, coal, something)


-   Measures taken by Britain and France


-   Were allies with Italy in the Stresa Front, so did not want to offend Mussolini

-   * Did not close the Suez Canal to Italian ships → Italy could ship war supplies to Abyssinia

-   Hoare-Laval Plan: to secretly give two-thirds of Abyssinia to Italy to stop invasion


-   Outcome:


-    Information about the pact was leaked to the press and the public reaction was one of anger. Laval and Hoare were made to resign and the League’s reputation was beyond repair


-   Significance:


-   It showed that Britain and France were willing to undermine the League to protect their own interests

-   The League was supposed to protect smaller countries, but Italy was given the rights to Abyssinian land after its aggressive actions


-   9 May 1926: Italy conquered Abyssinia

-   Nov 1936: Mussolini and Hitler signed a treaty of friendship establishing the Rome-Berlin Axis




-   OVERALL OUTCOME


-   Convinced Hitler that the League would be unable to stop his ambitious plans for expansion

-   Loss of faith

-   Collective security was shown to be an empty promise

-   The League of Nations had failed

F - rench and British self-interest

A - bsent powers

I - neffective sanctions

L - ack of an army

U - nfair treaties

R - eaching decisions too slowly

E - veryone had to agree

## German aggression and appeasement

1933 - Germany withdrew LoN

            Hitler stepped up Germany’s rearmament programme

1936 - Remilitarised Rhineland

1937 - Germany enter the Spanish Civil War on side of Nationalists

1938 - Anschluss with Austria

    Control of Sudentenland (oct)

1939 - Germany control the rest of Czechoslovakia (march)

Invasion of Poland (sept)

-   ##### Hitler’s Aggressive Expansionist Foreign Policy


-   Greater Germany


-   Wanted lost German territories

-   Unite with Austria

-   Create Lebensraum e.g. Russia, Poland


-   Treaty of Versailles


-   Hated the Treaty

-   Promised to abolish it


-   Hitler vs Communism


-   Anti-communist

-   Believed Bolsheviks should be destroyed


-   Racial superiority?


-   Exterminate inferior races, e,g, Slavs, Jews

STEP 1

-   Contributed greatly to the outbreak of WWII

-   After withdrawing from the Geneva Disarmament conference, he began secret rearmament and conscription from 1933-34

-   When the Allies found out in 1935, France protested but was not willing to impose sanctions/take further actions without British support. Hitler claimed self-defence

-   1935 June - Britain signs Anglo-German Naval Agreement; allowing Germany to build up their navy to ⅓ British fleet

STEP 2

-   France & USSR signed Franco-Soviet Pact in response to german remilitarisation

-   Hitler claimed that the Rhineland was under threat from the new alliance, hence he should be allowed to remilitarise Rhineland and defend German land


-   Hitler took a gamble that Britain and France would not respond

-   The League was preoccupied with the Abyssinian Crisis & did nothing except verbally condemn his actions

-   Made Hitler really popular (!) & bolder

STEP 3

-   Hitler sent soldiers, equipment and warplanes to support Spanish Nationalist forces vs Communists in the Spanish Civil War in 1937

-   He justified involvement using a common hatred for communism

-   Britain, France & the League, therefore, took no action




        STEP 4: Anschluss (Union) with Austria

-   Many Austria-born Germans supported political union between Germany and Austria since late 1800s

-   Hitler encouraged Austrian Nazis to stir up trouble & push for union

-   Pressured Austrian Chancellor Schuschingg

-   A Plebiscite was conducted; During the voting, Hitler sent troops to “keep peace”

-   99.75% voted for Anschluss

-   Austria annexed 13 March 1938.

STEP 5: Sudentenland and Czechoslovakia

-   Due to ToV, the population of Sudetenland was largely ethnic Germans

-   Hitler instigated the Nazi Party in Sudetenland to stir up trouble

-   When the Czech govt, suppressed the trouble-makers, Hitler threatened to go to war to protect ethnic Germans

-   Czechoslovakia had a modern army and all its defensive forts were in Sudetenland

-   Sudetenland also had important industrial resources

-   Czech President was willing to go to war with Germany; protected by Franco-Soviet pact

-   However, Britain was keen to avert war

-   Neville Chamberlain went to Germany on his accord to meet Hitler in Sept 1938


-   First meeting: Agreed on a plebiscite; allow people of Sudetenland to decide whom to belong to. Chamberlain returns home and convinces France and Czechoslovakia to agree, albeit reluctantly

-   Second meeting: Hitler changes tune, demands for ALL of Sudetenland & all Germans to return; Chamberlain rejects; Britain & France preps for war


-   Italy chairs the Munich Conference on 29 Sept  1938, inviting Britain, France & Germany to a meeting in order to avoid war

-   Sudetenland was conceded to Germany; Britain and Germany re-affirm their friendship and desire never to go to war

-   Chamberlain went home a public hero - “peace with honour… peace in our time”

-   Churchill called the Munich Agreement - “a total, unmitigated defeat”

-   Czechoslovakia and USSR were not consulted; Britain informed Czech leaders if they did not accept the Agreement, they would face Germany alone

-   Edvard Benes resigned; German soldiers marched into Sudetenland on 1 October.

-   16 March 1939, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia

-   Britain & France finally realised that Hitler could not be trusted… threatened to go to war if Germany invaded Poland




-   ##### Policy of Appeasement

Instituted in the hope of avoiding war, this was the name given to Britain’s policy in the 1930s of allowing Hitler to expand German territory unchecked

Eg. Munich Agreement; 29 Sept 1938 

-   (i) Fear of Another War Similar to WWI


-   WWI affected Britain and France tremendously; est 2.2m dead and 6.3m wounded

-   Public disgust towards war meant that countries could not afford to rearm

-   When Hitler remilitarized Rhineland, the public did not bother

-   Chamberlain was heralded as a hero post-Munich Conference


-   (ii) Effects of Great Depression


-   Britain and France were struggling with the effects of the Great Depression

-   France - over-value currency; political unrest

-   Britain - exports fell; more than 20% unemployed; industrial estates in poverty

-   Financial resources were required to create jobs, rather than spend on rearmament


-   (iii) USA Isolation & Need to Buy Time


-   The British and French govts privately believed that war may be necessary but did not believe they were strong enough to take on Germany

-   After WWI, they had not spent sufficiently to maintain their military

-   Could not rely on USA for help as USA was in isolation


-   (iv) Sympathy over Treaty of Versailles


-   Many British politicians felt ToV was too harsh

-   Chamberlain believed in Hitler’s grievances about problems caused by ToV, e.g. oppression of ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia

-   He believed Hitler could be appeased over the ToV in order to avoid another war


-   (v) Misjudgement of Hitler


-   British politicians admired Hitler even if they disagreed with his policies

-   They viewed him as strong and patriotic

-   Chamberlain believed that Hitler did not have unlimited aims and would cease making demands once he was able to revise the ToV.


-   (vi) Fear of Communism


-   Hitler’s strong stance on communism made him a potential ally against USSR

-   Communism was seen as bigger threat than Nazism / Fascism

-   They believed a strong Germany would be a buffer against the spread of communism




-   ##### Nazi-Soviet Pact


-   Signed 23 August 1939

-   Terms:


-   Germany and the USSR would not attack each other and would resolve any problems between them in a friendly manner

-   Recognition of Soviet rights over the Baltic states

-   Division of Eastern Europe and Poland into German and Soviet spheres of influence


-   Why did Hitler sign the pact?


-   Obtain half of Poland

-   Wanted to avoid a 2 front war; ensured Soviet neutrality


-   Why did Stalin sign the pact?


-   Distrusted the Allies


-   Munich Agreement

-   Frequent diplomatic snubs


-   Needed breathing space to prepare itself militarily for a possible war with Germany

-   Needed Poland to be a land buffer in the event of an invasion by Germany 


-   Key Significance: The pact eased Hitler’s fears of having to wage a two-front war and effectively paved the way for Germany's subsequent invasion of Poland

-   Consequence: Invasion of Poland!


-   Hitler demanded for return of Danzig and building of railroad across Polish corridor to East Prussia

-   1 Sept Hitler orders invasion of Poland

-   Britain & France issued 48-hour ultimatum to withdraw

-   Hitler did not believe

-   War declared on 3 Sept 1939

## Outbreak of ww2 in the pacific

### 1. rise of military japan

-   Secluded Society


-   Japan was a feudal state up till 1868 (Edo period)

-   High achievements in art (kabuki & bunraku theaters)

-   Suspected foreign traders & missionaries to be forerunners of western imperialism

-   Expelled foreigners & pursued isolation (Sakoku) in 1635




-   Humiliation of Japan


-   Mid 19th Century, Japan was forced by Western powers to open her ports for trade (gunboat diplomacy)

-   Japan was unable to stop them

-   Was forced to sign a number of unequal treaties b/w 1854-49

-   This was a sign of Western Imperialism conquering weak Asian countries

-   Tokugawa govt. forced to resign; Emperor restored




-   Historical and Cultural Legacies


-   Strong tradition and legacies that made Japanese favourable towards military influence in political matters

-   Japanese highly valued the honour-based samurai code: Justice, Courage, Mercy, Politeness, Sincerity, Honor, Loyalty, Self-control

-   Surrendering/backing down was highly dishonourable

-   Influenced how Japan reacted to threats of war & conducted relations with other nations




-   Modernisation of Japan


-   1871 - sent missions to Western countries to study their political and economic systems

-   Modernisesd army, navy, education system

-   1889 - Meidi Constitution introduced constitutional monarchy

-   Economical changes - land reforms to benefit peasants; no trade restrictions; industries established


→ By 1900, Japan was 1st industrialised country in Asia



-   Constitutional Monarchy


-   EMPEROR (advised by genro)


-   MILITARY (direct access and veto power)

-   PRIME MINISTER (appointed by Minister) 


-   DIET (parliament)


-   House of Peers (members of Imperial family, nobles)

-   House of representatives (elected by people, emperor can dismiss the house)


-   CABINET (appointed by emperor)




-   Early Signs of Militarism


-   By 1900, Japan was ready to challenge the foreign powers

-   Nationalistic leaders called for war against Western imperialists & sent secret agents into Manchuria, Mongolia & Siberia

-   Extremists wanted to get rid of democracy

-   Involvement in significant wars, WWI & Treaty of Versailles.

-   Japan strived to gain equality with the Western powers, building its own empire and obtaining large territories, esp. in East Asia.

-   Example: Conflict with Russia (1904 - 1905): Japan fought with Russia over Manchuria & Korea; Victory for Japan allowed them to gain control of Liaodong Peninsula (China), South Manchurian Railway, southern half of Sakhalin Island

-   Repercussions? (fight → win → expand); proud,  win all wars




-   The Failure of Democracy


-   Political


-   a) Structural problems within the political structure


-   The Diet’s limited power


-    No power to make decisions and its own policies


-   Lack of democratic control of the nation’s budget

-   Armed forced were directly accountable to the Emperor → army could act independently




-   b) Corruption damaged democracy’s reputation


-   Bribery of voters (Zaibatsus; rich national companies)

-   Frequent political scandals

-   Accusations of corruption between major political parties


                → Eroded public confidence + increasing disillusionment



-   c) Violence and disorderliness during Diet sessions


-   Outbreak of fistfights, brawls and other unseemly antics on the floor of the Diet


→ Tarnished the reputation of the parliamentary democracy as its processes was neither as orderly nor dignified as the educated classes expected them to be

-   Economic


-   a) The ailing countryside

Throughout the 1920s → farmers suffered a long-term drop in rice    prices

-   BUT the government increased rice imports from Korea and Taiwan


→ Helped urban consumers but deepened the economic troubles among the rural population

-   Bumper crops in the late 1920s depressed the rice price further


→ Net effect: Made life increasingly difficult for the country’s 5.5 million farm arnimals

-   Government increased subsidies to agriculture in the late 1920s but this had very little effect


→ *Continued agricultural depression made the rural population receptive to extremist / fervent nationalist ideas

-   b) The Great Depression


-   Japan’s economy significantly affected by USA and Britain’s protectionism

Eg. High taxes on Japanese silk → High prices on Japanese silk → People in other countries could not afford to buy Japanese silk → More people bought silk or cloth produced by their home countries → Decreased demand for Japanese silk

-   Large manufacturers…


-   Cut production

-   Reduced wages

-   Retrenched workers in great numbers


-   Small-scale enterprise and the rural population also suffered


-   c) Other unsolved problems


-   (i) Severe overpopulation


-   Rapid population increase led to shortage of land for farming

-   45 million in 1900 grew to 64 million by 1930

-   Demand grew for housing, goods and products

-   Expansionist ideas as a solution to problems increasingly attractive, e.g. Manchuria


-   (ii) Worker’s difficult conditions


-   Poor working (>10 hr per day) & living conditions (crowded, unhygienic, locked up!)

-   1921 - 25000 workers went on strike in Tokyo

-   Joined unions supported by Communists

-   Felt govt. did not care

-   Caused govt. to fear possible revolution


-   (iii) The Great Kanto Earthquake, 1923


-   Earthquake, followed by tsunami, fires that ravaged Yokohoma & Tokyo

-   Est. 140k dead

-   Traumatised nation, whipped up nationalist and racist passions.

-   Rebuilding of Tokyo symbolized an attempt to reconstruct the nation and its people


-   Significance: The economic crisis heightened discontent towards the civilian government and facilitated greater receptiveness towards the military and nationalists.

-   Patriotic societies grew in Japan - extremely nationalistic; believed Japan was superior to other nations

-   Support by Zaibatsu; “military govt will provide stable environment for business

-   Support by farmer - “Joining the army will provide stable salary

-   Support by discontented workers - “Govt. does not care! Corrupted!”




-   Social / Cultural : Rural / Urban Divide


-   In the cities: “new middle class” enjoyed relative prosperity


-   Increased literacy

-   New patterns of work consumption and amusement

-   Avid taste for the “modern” and the “cultured”


-   *Ultimately, the rural / urban divide fomented rural discontent which sought an outlet in a renewed commitment to the purity of the “Japanese spirit” and the “Japanese way of life”. This would soon find relief in a mounting enthusiasm for expansion abroad and restoration of national solidarity




-   Militarism → The belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend itself from outside threats or promote national interests

-   What led to the rise of militarism in Japan


-   External Reasons

Worsening relations b/w Japan and the West from 1919-1941

-   1. American Expansion in Asia-Pacific:


-   Conflict b/w USA and Japan over economic and military interests

-   Both countries saw Asia-Pacific as their backyard

-   By early 1900s, USA control expanded to Hawaii & Philippines


-   2. Racism faced by Japan:


-   US immigration laws (1882-1924): Banned Asian immigrants

-   Paris peace conference 1919: League refused to accept all races are equal (rejected by Britain, USA and Australia)

-   Washington Naval Conference 19321: Japan forced to accept naval reductions that favoured US & Britain (3 : 5 : 5)

-   London Disarmament Conference 1930: Japan still secondary to USA & Britain (7 : 10 : 10)


-   3. Resurgence of Chinese nationalism:


-   Since 1894, Japan took advantage of China

-   Rise of united China would be problematic

-   Wanted invasion of Manchuria & north China




-   Internal Reasons

Increasing support within Japan to adopt militarism

-   1. Patriotic societies


-   Grew in the 1920s

-   Close ties with army & navy

-   Extremely nationalistic & believed Japan superior to other nations

-   Expand Japan via military expansion

-   Aimed to get rid of democratic govt. And set up military dictatorship on behalf of Emperor


-   2. Army & Navy’s influence over govt.


-   Independent form govt.

-   Successes allowed army & navy to gain more influence over govt.

-   Democratic leaders who tried to reduce the military budget/ influence would be shot


-   Feb 1932, League of Blood incident. → political rivals 

-   May 1932, May 15 Incident → prime minister 

-   1936, Feb 26 incident


-   Desired an aggressive expansionist foreign policy (taking over other countries & territories for resources)

-   Early military successes


-   1894-95: Sino-Japanese War

-   1904-05: Russo-Japanese War

-   1905-10: Took over Korea

-   1914-18: Joined Allies during WWI

-   1915: 21 Demands for China


-   3.  Military Takeover of Japan


-   1930: PM Hamaguchi shot

-   1931: PM Tsuyoshi Inukai tried but failed to limit military spending & prevent invasion of Manchuria

-   He was assassinated in May 1932

-   Succeeding PMs had to support army or face danger

-   Emperor Hirohito was puppet figure

-   Parliamentary rule ended

-   Martial law declared

-   New cabinet had 10 military members & 5 political party members

-   Admiral Makoto Saito appointed Prime Minister (was also assinated later during Feb 26 Incident)

-   Politicians & emperor granted concessions to the military to prevent further violence

-

-   .

### 2. japan’s expansionist foreign policy

-   Main objectives:


-   (a) Taking control of territories near Japan to acquire resources


-   Japan had limited resources & depended on trade with others for essentials such as oil, steel

-   Protectionism adopted during the Great Depression made it harder to obtain raw materials from markets it did not control

-   Aggressive takeovers yielded benefits: e.g.


-   Taiwan – sugar

-   Korea – strategic location to defend Japanese isles & provide cotton, wool

-   Manchuria – defend Korea, provide minerals and wheat, land for growing Japanese population


-   (b) Achieve equality and recognition amongst world powers


-    Early successes in conflicts against other world powers brought confidence in military

-   The benefits of having its own empire similar to the Europeans encouraged further conquests


-   Creation of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere


-   Japanese domination of East Asia (EA) &Southeast Asia (SEA)

-   Expel European powers & replace them with satellite states loyal to Japan

-   Territories to be defended by Japanese military & governed through local elites supported by Japanese advisors

-   SEA was vital for raw materials such as rubber & oil

-   Several countries in SEA were seeking independence from European rule; Japan promised to liberate them,

-   Adopted propaganda e.g. ‘Asia for Asians’

### 3. weaknesses of the league of nations

-   Why China?


-   1. Value of Manchuria


-   Economically: Rich in raw materials & food resources (soya bean, bean cake, coal & iron); market to sell Japanese products (8% of all Japanese exports)

-   Strategic location: block Soviet Union from Korea & future expansion into China

-   However, Manchuria may not be as lucrative/ profitable as suggested


-   2. China was still in chaos


-   Warlod era, 1916 - 1928

-   Chinese Civil War between KMT and CCP, 1927 onwards (ended in 1949 after WWII)

-   Japanese military could take advantage, rather than wait for the war to end and face a united China




-   Invasion of Manchuria


-   The Mukden Incident


-   June 1931 Chinese caught 2 Jap spies and killed them

-   18 Sept ‘31 Kwantung Army accused Chinese soldiers of an attempt to bomb a South Manchurian Railway train

-   Demanded the Japanese govt to take action to protect their investments

-   Used excuse to invade Manchuria


-   War ministry disobeyed the govt. & appointed the last Manchu emperor of China, Puyi (3 year old boy), as the regent

-   Civilian govt in Tokyo could not stop the army

-   The govt recognized Manchukuo and placed control with the Kwantung Army

-   Chiang Kai Shek chose to continue the civil war against the CCP; appealed to the League of Nations for help against the Japanese.




-   League’s Response


-   Commisioned an investigation led by lord Lytton

-   Lytton Report stated that Japanese army’s response went beyond self-defence

-   League raised a motion & condemned Japan as an aggressor, refusing to recognise Manchukuo

-   Japanese delegation walked out & withdrew from League formally

-   League could not enforce its decisions


-   Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)


-   Marco Polo Bridge Incident 1937

-   Chinese troops mistakenly fired shots at Japanese troops who were deliberatly performing military drills near the bridge

-   A japanese officer went missing

-   Japan demanded China let their army in to search for the missing officer

-   When China refused, Japan declared war

-   July: captured Beijing

-   December: Shanghai & Nanjing

-   League was not willing to intervene, occupied with Hitler’s expansionist policy in Europe.

-   Only when scale of violence in Nanjing was exposed tothe media, West began to supply the KMT govt with weapons & cut off supplies to Japan.

-   Japan decided to invade SEA to cut off China’s supplies

### 4. worsening relations with the usa

-   Worsening relations - pre 1930s


-   US presence in Asia

-   Perceived racist attitude towards Japan


-   A series of America actions antagonized by the Japanese


-   USA’s isolationist policy in the 1930s + 1937 Neutrality Act (cannot travel to warring countries/take ships by warring countries) = non-intervention

-   However, after Japanese aggression in China, USA provided military aid to China; cancelled 1911 commercial treaty with Japan → restricts trade

-   1940: USA imposed trade embargo on japan occupation of Vietna, banned export of steel, scrap iron, fuel

-   Froze japanese assets in USA

-   USA supplied 80% of Japan’s steel & scrap iron supplies;

-   Oil embargo left Japan with 2 year’s supply

-   USA hoped to force Japan to end war in China & limit its expansion

### 5. attack on pearl harbour

-   Reasons for bombing Pearl Harbour


-   1. Desire to continue expanding its empire/Power vacuum in Southeast Asia


-   Outbreak of WWII in Europe in 1939 = British and French defenses in SEA were compromised

-   By May 1940, France was occupied and Britain left to fend for itself vs Germany

-   French Indochina and British colonies were easy targets for Japanese invasion

-   Only obstacle left was the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour


-   2. Revenged against USA/ Due to deteriorating relationship


-   US sanctions forced Japan into a corner

-   Japanese politicians could not afford to back down

-   Emperor feared the anger and power of military, unwilling to embarrass himself or endanger Japan’s imperial interests in China

-   Military advised an attack on USA – quick knockout blow would allow rapid expansion into SEA & force USA to negotiate a peace settlement

-   Oct 1941: Prince Konoe resigned as PM, reluctant to go to war

-   War minister Hideki Tojo appointed as PM

-   5 Nov 1941: Tojo’s war plans against USA, Britain and the Netherlands approved by emperor

-   Plans involved surprise attacks on Pearl Harbour and Southeast Asia – quick ‘knockout’ blow and element of surprise

-   Last ditch efforts to reach a compromise

-   3. Destroy US power in the Pacific fleet


-   Pacific fleet: 17 battleships, 11 aircraft carriers, 40 cruisers, 70 submarines, >100 submarines

-   USA had a large Pacific fleet to protect its territories and trading ships

-   After Japanese aggression against China and Indochina, US increased size of navy; Moved fleet to Pearl Harbour

-   Troop reinforcements sent to Philippines & other islands in the Pacific

-   The Pacific fleet had the necessary air and sea power to control the Asia-Pacific region & Southeast Asia

-   Weakness: American military planners did not think that a Japanese attack could reach the far east without being detected.

-   Japanese military felt need to cripple Pacific Fleet to buy time & protect conquests in SEA


-   Impact of Attack


-   The Japanese fleet sailed for 11 days in radio silence

-   Japanese diplomats continued the ruse of diplomatic negotiation in Washington.

-   7.55am on 7 Dec 1941- 360 torpedo planes, bombers & fighters attacked Pearl Harbor

-   Severely damaged US Pacific Fleet

-   US losses: 21 ships (some salvageable), 300 warplanes, 2400+ men

-   Japan losses: 0 ships, 29 planes, 100 men

-   US military capabilities not destroyed because:


-   Japan concentrated on warships

-   Did not attack buildings, power plants & oil supplies

-   No aircraft carriers destroyed

-   US managed to restore less damaged vessels within 6 months

-   The main bulk of the Pacific fleet was out on patrol. 


-   USA declared war on Japan 8 Dec 1941, thus entering WWII

# Wwii

## 01 early axis successes

-   Europe (EU): Reasons for German success [###](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II/Forces-and-resources-of-the-European-combatants-1939)


-   Germany


-   Started preparation for the war when Hitler came to power

-   Wehrmacht was much more equipped with superior firepower

-   Luftwaffe was best of its kind un 1939

-   Blitzkrieg (lightning war) used to devastating effect


-   Stage 1: Dive bombers attack key targets, eg. roads, railway, stations, airfields to destroy enemy communications

-   Stage 2: Tanks & motorized artillery punch holes in enemy line, isolate segments of enemy; surrounded & captured by infantry divisions

-   Stage 3: Large number of troops move in, travelling as fast as possible


-   Britain, France & Allies


-   Due to the great Depression, did not start rearming till late 1930s

-   Obsolete WWI equipment, eg. Fra 131/634 planes & nearly all 400+ bombers were obselete


-   TIMELINE OF KEY EVENTS: 1939 - 1941


-   Sept 1939: Germany invaded & occupied Poland

-   April / May 1940: Germany invaded & occupied Denmark & Norway

-   10-14/15 May 1940: Germany launched blitzkrieg against Holland and Belgium, occupied both

-   22 June 1941: Germany invades USSR (Operation Barbarossa)*

-   7 Dec 1941: Japan bombs Pearl Habour


-   Asia-Pacific (AP): Reasons for Japanese success


-   WWII in Europe- BR and FRA were too busy fighting GER to defend their colonies in Asia

-   All available resources were redeployed

-   Japanese troops were battle-hardened ( fighting since 1937 Sino-Japanese War) vs Inexperienced Allied troops (British soldiers had never fought in jungles

-   Both BR & FRA underestimated the Japanese military’s capabilities & use of blitzkrieg


-   Brutality during WWII


-   Germans


-   Attempted racial annihilation of Jews, Russians

-   Other victims often included gypsies, patients with disabilities

-   Extreme cruelty to Soviet POW


-   Japanese


-   Kempeitai = use of torture, mass executions to instil fear amongst locals

-   Notable crimes included:


-   Sandakan death marches

-   Forcing women of occupied territories to serve as sex workers

-   Death Railway

-   Biological & chemical testing on POW & civilians 




-   In early 1942, Germany and Japan looked invincible with much of Europe and Asia occupied by the Axis powers

-   Britain & the USSR barely survived onslaughts while USA was just getting started

-   However, the tide turned by late 1942 as both Germany and Japan started experiencing setbacks

-   By April ‘45 Gitler committed suicide; Germany surrendered in May

-   Japan announced its surrender in August & officially did so in September ‘45

-   Why were Germany & Japan defeated?

## 02 germany’s defeat

-   WHERE TO PUT   huh there wasnt a fitting place to put the battle of britain  oh ok. Do we have to type this down nah ok

-   Battle of Britain, 1940


-   RAF Strengths


-   RAF led by Sir Hugh Dowding - planned British air defence since 1947. Brought in technical developments, eg. bullet proof windscreens for fighter planes; command & communiation systems

-   Invested in radars, able to detect enemy planes before they arrived

-   Fighter planes such as Spitfire & Hurricanes were faster than German planes

-   RAF pilots who bailed out over Britain could return to duty


-   LuftWaffe Weaknesses


-   Hermann Goering was not good at tactics - shifted focus of attacks, causing confusion; Did not implement radars

-   Wrong type of aircraft- Stuka dive bomber were geared towards supporting army by bombing, not dog fights

-   German fighters only had enough fuel to fly for 3o min over England and had to return to France

-   German pilots who bailed out over Brtain became prisoners


-   US Role


-   Pre-Pearl Harbour


-   USA was in isolation since the end of WWI

-   1937 Neutrality Act

-   Recognised the threat of GER, ITA and JAP

-   Revised the Neutrality Act in 1939 and provided aid for the Allies

-   1939: “Cash & Carry” (sold arams while maintaining neutarality

-   Marh 1941: With France defeated and Britain financially crippled, USA introduced Lend-Lease Act

-   Roosevelt’s speech on the USA as an “arsenal of democracy”, justifying increase of aid

-   Payment could be deferred

-   USA provided transportation of supplies

-   Spent almost US$50 billion

-   Effectiveness:


-   Kept Allies afloat in the war


-   3. Escort Roles
