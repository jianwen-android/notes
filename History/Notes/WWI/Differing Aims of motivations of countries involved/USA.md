# USA

## Aims

- Wilson wanted to establish his Fourteen Points as a basis for lasting peace and international cooperation
    - Self-determination
    - Disarmament
    - Establishing the League of Nations

## Reasons

- Starkly different war experience
- Entered the war late (1917)
- Suffered comparatively little
- The war was not fought on American soil

Therefore, it was not compelled to seek harsh reparations as they had not suffered as much
as compared to the other European countries.

Wilson wanted a part in the League of Nations and to referee peace for the European
countries

However,
the American people wanted to keep the USA out of future foreign entanglements - **isolationism**
