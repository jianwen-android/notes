# France

## Aims

- Hoped to reclaim **Alsace-Lorraine**
- Wanted Germany to:
    - Pay **heavy reparations**
    - **Accept total blame** for the war
- Wanted **revenge and compensation** for its war losses

### Vindictive peace

- Revenge
- Only way to get peace is if you get destroyed

## Reasons

- France was attacked by Germany twice, in 1970 and 1914 respectively
    - Lost valuable land like Alsace-Lorraine

Therefore they sought to weaken Germany militarily so as to protect French security
