# Reasons for bombing Pearl Harbour

1. Desire to continue expanding its empire/Power vacuum in Southeast Asia
    1. Outbreak of WWII in Europe in 1939 = British & French defenses in SEA were compromised
    2. By May 1940, France was occupied & Britain left to fend for itself vs Germany
    3. French Indochina & British colonies were easy targets for Japanese invasion
    4. Only obstacle left was the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbour
2. Revenge against USA/ Due to deteriorating relationship
    1. US snactions* foced Japan into a corner
    2. Japanese politicians could not afford to back down
    3. Emperor feared the anger & the power of military, unwilling to embarrass himself or endanger Japan’s imperial interests in China
    4. Military advised an attack on USA - quick knockout blow would allow rapid expansion into SEA & force USA to negotiate a peace settlement
    5. Oct 1941: Prince Konoe resigned as Prime Minister, reluctant to go to war
    6. War Minister Hideki Tojo appointed as Prime Minister
    7. 5 Nov 1941: Tojo’s war plans against USA, Britain & the Netherlands approved by the emperor
    8. Plans involved surprise attacks on Pearl Harbour and Southeat Asia - quick ‘knockout’ blow and element of surprise
    9. Last ditch efforts to reach a compromise failed
    
    | US Suggestions | Japanese Suggestions |
    | --- | --- |
    | Japan should return the land it had conquered and go back to borers that were in place in 1931 | Japan offered to pull its troops from China in phases, taking place over 25 years |
    | Japan should give up all claims on China | Ministers from Japan and China would form a new government in China and rule China together |
    | Japan should remove its troops from Manchukuo | China would accept that Manchukuo was no longer of China |
3. Destroy US power in the Pacific
    1. USA had a large Pacific Fleet to protect its territories & trading ships
    2. After Japanese aggression against China & Indochina, US increased size of navy; Moved fleet to Pearl Harbour
    3. Troop reinforments sent to Philippines & other islands in the Pacific
    4. 17 battleships, 11 aircraft carriers, 40 cruisers, 70 submarines, > 100 destroyers
    5. The Pacific Fleet had the necessary air & sea power to control the Asia-Pacific region & Southeast Asia
    6. Weakness: American military planners did not think that a Japanese attack could reach the far east without being detected.
    7. Japanese military felt need to cripple Pacific Fleet to buy time & protect conquests in SEA
    8. The Japanese fleet sailed for 11 days in radio silence
    9. Japanese diplomats continued the ruse of diplomatic negotiation in Washington
    10. 7.55am on 7 Dec 1941 - 360 torpedo places, bombers & fighters attacked Pearl Harbour
    11. Severely damaged US Pacific Fleet
        1. US losses: 21 ships, 300 warplanes, 2400+ men
        2. Japan losses: 0 ships, 29 planes, 100 men
