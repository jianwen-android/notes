# Main objectives:

1. Taking control of territories near Japan to acquire resources
    1. Japan had limited resources & depended on trade with others fro essentials such as oil, steel
    2. Protectionism adopted during the Great Depression made it harder to obtain raw materials from markets it did not control
    3. Aggressive takeovers yielded benefits:
    
    | Taiwan | Sugar |
    | --- | --- |
    | Korea | Strategic location to defend Japanese idles & provide cotton, wool |
    | Manchuria | defend Korea, provide minerals and wheat, land for growing Japanese population |
2. Achieve equality and recognition amongst world powers
    1. Early successes in conflicts against other world powers brought confidence in military
    2. The benefits of having its own empire similar to the Europeans encouraged further conquests
    3. Creation of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
        1. Japanese domination of East Asia (EA) & Southeast Asia (SEA)
        2. Expel European powers & replace them with satellite states loyal to Japan
        3. Territories to be defended by Japanese military & governed through local elites supported by Japanese advisors
        4. SEA was vital for raw materials such as rubber & oil
        5. Several countries in SEA were seeking independence from European rule; Japan promised to liberate them,
        6. Adopted propaganda e.g. ‘Asia for Asians’
