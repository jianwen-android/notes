*Was conflict between Japan and the USA inevtiable?*

- A series of American actions antagonized the Japanese
    - USA’s isolationist policy in the 1930s + 1937 Neutrality Act = non-intervention?
    - H/w, after Japanese aggression in Chinese, USA provided military aid to China; cancelled 1911 commercial treaty with Japan; restricts trade
    - 1940: USA imposed trade embargo on Japan after occupation of Vietnam; banned export of steel, scrap, iron and fuel
    - Froze Japanese assets in USA
    - USA supplied 80% of Japan’s steel & scrap iron supplies;
    - Oil embargo left Japan with 2 year’s supply
    - USA hoped to force Japan to end war in China & limit its expansion
    - Japan’s alternatives? Comply/ Retaliate?
