*The belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend itself from outside threats or promote national interests*

# What led to the rise of militarism in Japan?

## External Reason

- Worserning relations between Japan & the West from 1919-1941

### American Expansion in Asia-Pacific

- conflict between USA & Japan over economic & military interests
- Both countries saw Asia-Pacific as their backyard
- By early 1900s, USA control expanded to Hawaii & Philipines

### Racism faced by Japan:

- US Immigration Laws (1882-1924): Banned ASian immigrants;
- Paris Peace Conference 1919: League refused to accept all races equal (rejeted by Britain & Australia)
- Washington Naval Conference 1921: Japan forced to accept naval reductions that favored US & Britain (3:5:5)
- London Disarmament Conference 1930: Japan still secondary to USA & Britain (7:10:10)
