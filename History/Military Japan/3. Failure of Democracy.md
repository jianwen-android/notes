# Political

1. Structural problems within the political structure
2. Corruption damaged democracy’s reputation
3. Violence and disorderliness during Diet sessions
- The Diet’s limited power
    - No power to make decisions and its own policies
- Lack of democratic control of the nation’s budget
- Armed forces were directly accountable to the Emporer → army could act independantly
- Bribery of voters
- Frequent political scandals
- Accusations of corrruption between the major political parties

## Violence and disorderliness

- Outbreak of fistfights, brawls and other unseemly antics on the floor of the Diet → Tarnished the reputation of parliamentary denocracy as its processses were neither as orderly nor dignified as the eeducated class expected them to be

# Economic ~~(Only 1 tested?)~~

## The ailing countryside

Throughtout the 1920s → farmers suffered from a long-term drop in rich prices

- But the government increased rice imports from Korea and Taiwan
- Bumper crops in the late 1920s depressed the rice price further

→ helped urban consumers but deepened the economic troubles among the rural population

→ made life increasingly difficult for the country’s 5.5 million farm families

Government increased subsidies to agriculture in the late 1920s but this had very little effect → Continued agricultural depression made the rural population receptive to extermist/ fervent nationalist ideas

## The Great Depression

- Japan’s economy significantly affected by USA & the Britains
1. High taxes on Japanese silk
2. High prices on Japanese silk
3. People in other countries could not afford to buy Japanese silk
4. More people bought silk or cloth produced by their home countries
5. Decreased demand for Japanese silk

- Large manufacturers
    - Cut production
    - Reduced wages
    - Retrenched workers in great numbers
- Small-scale enterprise and the rural population also suffered

## Other unsolved problems

### Sever underpopulation

- Rapid population increase led to shortage of land for framing
- 45 million in 1900 grew to 64 million by 1930
- Demand grew for housing, goods and products
- Expasionist ideas as a solution to problems increasingly attractive, e.g. Manchuria

### Workers’ difficult conditions

- Poor working (>10 hrs a day) & living conditions (crowded, unhygienic, locked up!)
- 1921 - 25 000 workers went on strike in Tokyo
- Joined unions supported by Communists
- Felt government did not care
- Caused government to fear possible revolution

### The Great Kanto Earthquake, 1923

- Earthquake, followed by tsunami, fires that ravaged Yokohama & Tokyo
- Est. 140k dead
- Traumatised nation, whipped up nationalist & racist passions
- Rebuilding of Tokyo symbolized an attempt to reconstruct the nation and its people

<aside>
⭐  Significance: The economic crisis heightened discontent towards the civilian government and facilitated greater receptiveness towards the military and nationalists

</aside>

Patriotic societies grew in Japan - extremely nationalistic; believed Japan was superior to other nations

### Rise of Militarism

- Support by zaibatsu
    - Military govt will provide stable environment for business
- Support by farmer
    - Joining the army will provide stable salary
- Support by discontented workers
    - Govt doesn’t care! Corrupted!

# Social/Cultural

## Rural/ Urban divide

- In the cities: “new middle class” enjoyed relative prosperity
    - Increased literacy
    - New patterns of war, consuption and amusement
    - Avid taste for the “mordern” and the “cultured”

<aside>
⭐ Ultimately, the rural/ urban divide fomented rural discontent which sought an outlet in a renewed commitment to the purity of the “Japanese spirit” and “Japanese way of life”. This would soon find relief in a mounting enthusiasm for expansion abroad and restoration of national solidarity
