The historian aimed to educate readers on the peasants under Stalin's collectivization policy and let readers sympathize with them.

From the source, the historian says that "The great majority of peasants hated Stalin's collectivization policy, and would never willingly cooperate with it.". However, "they were forced to" and "the soldiers simply seized all their stocks of grains". The historian then shares about the dilemma that the peasants faced - on the one hand, if they handed over their food, they would starve. On the other hand, if they tried to hide it, soldiers would shoot them. In Ukraine, where most farmers were, most peasants decided to kill and eat their animals while they still could, resulting in a famine.

As a result, the readers would feel sympathetic for the mistreatment of the farmers; they would understand the helplessness of their situation. The readers will also feel angst towards Stalin's collectivization policy, now knowing that many farmers did not willingly participate in the collectivization and were killed unjustly.
