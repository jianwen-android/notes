1. The Treaty of Versailles' (ToV) war guilt clause - it explicitly and directly blamed Germany for the outbreak of war. This meant that not only were the Germans humiliated, they were also forced to pay heavy war reparations (6.6 million pounds) to the allied countries 
2. The Treaty of Versailles also demanded Germany to demilitarise - the German Army was restricted to 100,000 men, Navy was limited to 15,000 men, disallowed from having an air force, tanks and submarines, conscription was prohibited. Demilitarisation not only meant the lack of defence against any invading country, but also a significant increase in unemployment as soldiers who fought in WWI no longer had their jobs
