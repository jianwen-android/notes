The message from the General Officer was that Stalin's collectivisation could greatly benefit the farmers.

Firstly, the General Officer heavily emphasises on how the collective farm under his charge had "more than 600 hectares; of these, 123 were sown with cotton and 225 planted with wheat." and that their "three lorries are always full". The general officer was trying to convince farmers that might read his account, that giving up their farm to the state could greatly increase their produce.

Secondly, the General Officer flaunts the improvements to the lives of the farmers who worked in said collective farms, saying that the "farmers have built 70 new houses for themselves during the last few years." and that if you were "look inside these houses", you would "find rich carpets and musical instruments", signs of wealth. The general officer ends off with a cheers to Stalin and we can see that he was showing off the wealth that the farmers had gained from the supposed "600 hectares" of produce and the benefits of collectivisation as a whole.

Therefore, I can infer that the General officer was attempting to promote collectivisation to the farmers of Russia, to get them to surrender their farms to the state. Thus, the message from the general officer was that Stalin's collectivisation could greatly benefit the farmers.
