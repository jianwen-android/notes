# Berlin blockage (June 1948 - May 1949)

- Stalin was angered by the actions of the Western powers to reunify Germany
	- therefore, decided to blockade the 3 western zones of Berlin
- Official reason - "Prevent devalued Reichsmarks from entering Soviet zone"
- forces the Western powers out of Berlin
	- Western Berlin gives the west legit reason to traverse into East Germany
	- not good cause they can spy and all that
- make Berlin dependant on USSR by starving the people heheheehhhehehhee
