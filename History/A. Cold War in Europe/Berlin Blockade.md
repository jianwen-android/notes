# Berlin blockage (June 1948 - May 1949)

## Timeline

- Stalin was angered by the actions of the Western powers to reunify Germany
	- therefore, decided to blockade the 3 western zones of Berlin
- Official reason - "Prevent devalued Reichsmarks from entering Soviet zone"
- forces the Western powers out of Berlin
	- Western Berlin gives the west legit reason to traverse into East Germany
	- not good cause they can spy and all that
- make Berlin dependant on USSR by starving the people heheheehhhehehhee

### American response

- Harry Truman flew in supplies to the people for 11 months
	- as part of his Doctrine, he promised to help others against communism
- Berlin became a symbol of freedom behind the 'iron curtain'

### Soviet response (?)

- The Soviets did not interfere with the flying in of supplies
	- act of aggression/war
- Stalin removed the blockade after 11 months

## Why the blockade backfired on Stalin

- having setup the blockade on the basis of preventing devalued currency from causing economic chaos
	- Stalin could not afford to shoot down the allied supply planes
	- it would lead to an international backlash

## Other loopholes with the Berlin Blockade

- Excerpt from historian article
	- The blockade was lax & Sovet-area supplies flowed through Berlin's gates, therefore defeating Soviet pressure on Berlin
	- West Berliners could obtain goods in Black & legal markets. Soviet wanted to profit from business with West Berliners who could pay exorbitant prices for food, cigarettes, textiles & luxury goods
	- USA downplayed the leackages in the blockade to emphasize their own role
	- Airlift provided enough food, coal to meet basic household needs; However, without Soviet area goods, West Berlin's economy would have collapsed

## Effects of the Bloackade

### 1. Increased hostility between the two blocs

- Failure of the blockade humiliated USSR
- boosted US credibility & displayed their technological edge
	- didnt kill anyone while dropping food
	- converted WW2 planes to airdrop supplies
- soviet act of aggression resolved French misgivings about helping to strengthen Western zones of Germany

### 2. Divided Germany into two

- 3 western zones merged to form the German Federal Republic (West Germany)
- Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)

### 3. Berlin blockade showed the West that they needed to cooperate to stop Soviet aggression

- Led to the formation of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, April 1949)

#### NATO agreement

- an armed attack against one member would be taken as an attack against them all
- became a safeguard against Soviet Expansion into Western Europe

### 4. The Warsaw Pact (1955)

- to counter NATO
	- USSR signed a mutual defence treaty with her Eastern European satellites
	- Military complement to Cominform & Comecon
	- H/w, it was seen as an attempt by the USSR to strengthen hold over satellite states
