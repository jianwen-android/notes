## Why were the 2 systems unable to co-exist?

- Marx's theory that all Capitalist class will one day be over-pushed by Working class (Class struggle)
- Capitalist fear of the Domino Theory - must prevent at any cost
- Led to deep mistrust/ conflicts between both systems
- E.g. Post-WWII Communist parties in Russia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Greece, etc.

- 40 million dead
- Buildings, infrastructures reduced to rubble
- Refugees of war relocating to find new homes
- Agricultural & industrial outputs havled
- Govts bankrupt


- Govts & empires collapsed
- Germany, Italy, France & Britian were no longer able to dominate politics/post-war decisions (textbook pg 12)
- Needed outside help to rebuild
- This allowed USA & USSR to compete for a role in reconstructing Europe, increasing their political & economic influence


- USA emerged from WWII virtually unscathed - with a powerful military & economy
- USSR. built a sphere of incluence
