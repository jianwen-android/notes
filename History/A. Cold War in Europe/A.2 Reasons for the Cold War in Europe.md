### Why were the 2 systems unable to co-exist?

- Marx's theory that all Capitalist class will one day be over-pushed by Working class (Class struggle)
- Capitalist fear of the Domino Theory - must prevent at any cost
- Led to deep mistrust/ conflicts between both systems
- E.g. Post-WWII Communist parties in Russia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Greece, etc.
