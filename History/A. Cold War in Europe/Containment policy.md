8000 word essay on a telegram

9 Feb - Stalin's speech on inherent conflict between communism & capitalism

George Kennan (US Deputy head of American Embassy in USSR) sent the 'Long Telegram' on 22 Feb, which became basis for the US policy of containment

- USSR justified its establishment of Eastern Europe as sphere of influence due to hostile historical experiences of being invaded from the east
- Aggressive expansion by USSR to spread its influence & dominance
- Isolation no longer an option; USA must be involved & adopt global strategy (be prepared to engage world wide) to deal with Soviets
- War not necessary - "long term, patient  but firm & vigilant containment" required

## Containment

- Lessons of WWI - isolation by USA led to European instability
- Did not want to repeat the mistakes post-WWI
- Every Communist action will lead to an American reaction 
	- ensure that USSR did not spread beyond the borders where it was already established
	- also means that you're always being forced to react, no preventive measures
- Containment policy marked clear shift away from isolationism
