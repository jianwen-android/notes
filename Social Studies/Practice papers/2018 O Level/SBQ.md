# Q1

## Agree

The main message is that **globalisation is ==beneficial in bringing about unity and harmony/bridging cultural differences, bringing people of diverse cultures together.==** This is evident when the author titles his cartoon as "Out of many comes one", which implies that despite the differences in SES and culture, one common identity and understanding emerges from homogenisation. From the cartoon, we can see that people from diverse backgrounds are purchasing the same meal from the fastfood restaurant and a man at the backm, remarks at the commonality that they shared by stating "Me too! Who says we can't get along." This shows the supportive stance of the author for globalisation, which brings people closer.

## Disagree

The main message is that globalisation results in ==homogenisation of culture==, **which shows that the author is mocking the cultural impacts of globalisation to be eroding the diversity of cultures, resulting in commonality.** This is evident from the source when the author titles the cartoon as "out of many" comes one, which implies that **diversity is replace with one common identity**. From the cartoon, we can see that people from diverse backgrounds are purchasing the same meal from the fastfood restaurant and a man at the back, remarks at the commonality that they shared by stating "Me too! Who says we can't get along." This is highly sarcastic which is a way to mock the **trivalising true understanding of one another as it is based on fastfood**, which is a superficial understanding. **Thus author is critical of globalisation which creates a superficial understanding and togetherness.**
