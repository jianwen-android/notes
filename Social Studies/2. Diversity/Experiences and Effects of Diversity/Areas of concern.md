> [!question] Would stopping manpower from coming into Singapore be a viable option?
> No

Companies need to source only Singaporean worker who may find work tough and not stay for long

- [ ] domestic workers -> take care of young and old so that the adults can go to work. without them, adult singaporeans will have to leave their jobs to take care of their loved ones, (destroy) households
- [ ] constructions -> less locals want to work in the construction industry; Singapore's development will be less-efficient
