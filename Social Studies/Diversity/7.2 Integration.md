## Policies

### Bilingualism

- require students to learn English and **one of the 3 official Mother Tongues**
	- Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil
- English serves as a common language for all Singaporeans
	- regardlesss of identity or background, allows us to communicate
- Mother tongue
	- makes us unique
	- preserves cultural uniqueness

### Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR)

- parliament **doesnt pass law that is detrimental or discriminatory to any religious/racial minority groups**
- reports on any matters affecting any communities

### Group Representation Constituencies (GRC)

- **ensure minority groups will always be represented in parliament**
- one member of the team contesting in the general elections must be from any minority ethnic group

### Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)

- ensure that no Housing and Development Board (HDB) estate in Singapore can become an **ethnic enclave** as all estates must have a balance of the different ethnic groups
- better opportunities for integration and harmony and social cohesion is strengthened in the process.

- people now think that EIP is used to prevent someone of a certain ethnic background from getting housing
- as Singapore's housing is decreasing and is becoming more expensive

### Singapore Citizenship Journey

- allow new immigrants to explore all the different parts of Singapore life
- passive thing integration

### Singapore Permanent Resident Quota

- create oppurtunities to allow immigrants to mix with Singaporeans
- ensure that new immigrants do not create their own enclaves

### National Service

- somehow, with the influx of immigrants
- integrates second-generation citizens
	- mix with Singaporeans and bond through 

### Community Integration Fund

- Participation in community events also helps in the integration process (link to citizenship).
- In 2009, the National Integration Council (NIC) set up the Community Integration Fund (CIF) to provide financial support to organisations that are interested in organising community integration projects. 
	- These projects include diversity workshops, cultural exchange programmes, sports- or arts-based programmes, etc. 
- The People's Association (PA) organises parties, festivals, tours to bring about integration between Singaporeans and immigrants. 
- These initiatives help new migrants to integrate better with less anxiety. Community Integration Fund (CIF)*

## Tensions

- Some Singaporeans are not ok with immigration policy
	- they feel that new immigrants do not wish to integrate into Singapore society.
	- they feel that jobs and job security for Singaporeans have been taken away with the arrival of immigrants in large numbers
	- they hold foreigners responsible for the escalation of prices of HDB flats, traffic congestion and increasing number of train breakdowns (blaming them for problems in quality of life)
	- they feel that the Singaporean identity and social cohesion has become weaker 
		- immigrants arrive in large numbers
		- and because of that, some immigrants' lack of ability to communicate in English 
		- their different social behaviours are seen as hinderances to integration
