# Market-based approach

![[Screenshot 2022-05-04 at 4.17.52 PM.png]]

## Public vs Private

- both private and public hospitals provide healthcare services
- 58% of hospitals are non-profit private hospitals
- 21% are profit-making private hospitals
- 25% are non-profit government hospitals

## Affordability

- government does not interfere in the price setting of healthcare service providers or which service provider citizens choose
- everything is charged and costs money
	- calling an ambulance
	- price-gouging of insulin
	- giving birth

- Americans use medical insurance to pay for healthcare
	- However, not all Americans are able to afford to pay for their insurance premiums
		- disabled etc.

### Medicare

- healthcare insurance provided for those 65 or above (years old)

### Medicaid

- healthcare insurance for people with very limitedf incomes or serious disabilities

### ACA

- allows all Americans (even those from lower SES and those with pre-existing conditions) to afford premiums
- poggers

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- encourages medical discoveries and innovation due to profitability
- led to a very high level of medical research and technology available in the U.S.

### Cons

- hard to try and balance between providing healthcare and maintaining the market-based approach
- healthcare insurance premiums are high so many people in the lower SES group choose not to buy insurance in order to meet other needs such as food, rent and transportation
- Smaller firms may also be unable to buy healthcare insurance for their employees and Americans may lose their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs.  

  

Insurance companies seek to make as much profits as possible and so they prefer to insure  

the healthy and employed. They very often reject applications from the unemployed and  

those with pre-existing medical conditions. Denying insurance to these groups effectively  

means that medical treatment is unavailable to the groups of people who need medical  

treatment the most

# Shared responsibility (Singapore)

- ensure that no SIngaporean is denied healthcare

## Private vs Public

- Public: 85% of beds for in-patients
- Private: remaining 15%
- differentiation in wards in public hospitals
	- Ward A receiving no government subsidies
	- Wards B and C providing government subsidies

## Affordability

### 1. Subsidies

- up to 80%
- government provides direct healthcare subsidies

### 2. Medisave

- compulsory medical saving schemes
- Working Singaporeans and their employers contribute a part of their monthly wage to the Medisave account. 
- they can withdraw from these savings for their medical needs when the need arises.

### 3. MediShield Life

- compulsory healthcare insurance plan for all Singaporeans
- cradle to grave, including those with pre-existing conditions 
- All Singaporeans contribute to this scheme and the money from the common pool will be used to meet the healthcare needs for all Singaporeans
- a portion of big medical bills will be covered by this plan
- co-payment is included in the scheme to ensure that individuals continue to take responsibility for their healthcare needs

### 4. MediFund (Only for the needy)

 - endowment fund that provides financial assistance to people who cannot afford to pay their medical bills after subsidies
 - optional and determined by government if your SES or income is low

## Problems

### Growing demands

- Singapore aging population increasing demand for healthcare and decreasing birthrates
	- less working class [[#Rising Healthcare costs]]
	- elderly recover longer and more likely to be hospitalised than the young

### Rising Healthcare costs

- more tax imposed on Singaporeans
- [[#Growing demands]] smaller working class has to pay more tax to take care of the aging population

# Government-financed

- Dont actually need insurance
- citizens are provided with near-free healthcare

## Affordability

- only Swedes above the age of twenty need to pay when they visit hospitals. Even so, they only need to pay €9 per day if they are hospitalised and this is capped at €122 per year.
- after €122, they do not need to pay any more money for the rest of the year
- couples only needs to pay a maximum of €244 for the healthcare needs of all the children in the family. Once this amount is reached, the family will get a 100% subsidy from the government for the healthcare needs of their children

## Problems

### Tax

- income tax can go as high as 51%
- VAT (GST) can go as high as 25%
- hospitals are funded solely on tax

### Growing demands

- similar to Singapore ![[#Growing demands]]
- ![[#Rising Healthcare costs]]

### Immigration

- should immigrants enjoy the same benefits (especially healthcare)?
- Swedes are proud of and satisfied with their universal healthcare system and resist any calls to change it
	- therefore, it makes it hard for the Swedish government to make changes to the government-financed healthcare approach
	- even though it is facing problems in sustainability
