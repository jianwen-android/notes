Some people say that using cash all the time is safer than using internet banking. What are your views?

Compare cash and internet banking:

- in terms of mindset
- and security

cash has security in being a physical item. whenever we make a transaction, we have to physically take notes or coins out of our wallets to give to someone. this makes it relatively hard to steal someone’s money, especially when it is kept in a secure place like a safe or in physical banks.

on the other hand, we have internet banking. 

internet banking security comes under the domain of cybersecurity.

cybersecurity talks about social engineering
